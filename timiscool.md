There once was a cheese-loving guy
Who couldn't resist a good buy
He'd munch and he'd nibble
On cheddar and brie-ble
Till his waistline expanded sky-high!

His passion for fromage was strong
He'd feast on it all day long
Gouda and Swiss
He just couldn't miss
His cheese obsession wasn't wrong

He'd travel the world for new tastes
From France to Italy he raced
Camembert and Roquefort
He'd always report
No morsel of cheese went to waste

His fridge was a dairy delight
Overflowing both day and night
With Parmesan and feta
There wasn't much betta'
Than his cheesy collection so bright

But alas, all this cheese took its toll
His pants wouldn't button or roll
He vowed to cut back
On his favorite snack
But cheese still had hold of his soul
