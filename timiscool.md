# Ode to Cheese

```markdown
Golden wheels of aged delight,
Creamy textures, pure and white,
From sharp cheddar to mild brie,
A world of flavors, wild and free.

Melted strings on pizza's face,
Crumbled feta's tangy grace,
Blue veins running through the bold,
Stories of tradition told.

Grilled between two slices bread,
On crackers served or wine-fed,
Cheese, oh cheese, you reign supreme,
In every dish, you are the dream.

From humble farms to gourmet plates,
Your presence always captivates,
A timeless food that never fails,
To bring joy wherever it prevails.
