```
There once was a connoisseur of cheese
Who sampled each type with great ease
    From Brie to Roquefort
    He'd happily sort
Through flavors that aimed to please
```

```
Trained tongue discerns cheese
Mild Gouda, wild Stilton's tang
Flavors teach lessons
```

```


He traveled the world for his passion
Tasting cheeses in curious fashion
    From Swiss in the Alps
    To Cheddar that scalps
His taste buds with flavor so dashin'

At last when his journey was done
He found that he'd only begun
    For cheese, he would say
    Evolves every day
A quest that is never quite won
```
