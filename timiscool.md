There once was a connoisseur of cheese
Who sampled each type with great ease
    From Brie to Roquefort
    He'd happily sort
Through flavors that aimed to please

His palate was trained to discern
The subtleties others might spurn
    Gouda so mild
    Or Stilton so wild
Each morsel a lesson to learn

He traveled the world for his passion
Tasting cheeses in curious fashion
    From Swiss in the Alps
    To Cheddar that scalps
His taste buds with flavor so dashin'

At last when his journey was done
He found that he'd only begun
    For cheese, he would say
    Evolves every day
A quest that is never quite won
