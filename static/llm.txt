  # How to Use and Customize the "Populate External Docs" Command in the VS Code Extension

## Step 1: Access the Command

1. Open your VS Code workspace
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette
3. Type "Populate External Docs" and select the command


## Step 2: Customizing Generation with dev-docs.json

To customize the documentation generation, modify the `dev-docs.json` file in your project root:

1. Create or open `dev-docs.json`
2. Add an `ai` object with customization options

Example `dev-docs.json`:

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "internalTypeFilters": ["class", "method", "function"],
    "codeFilters": [],
    "nameFilters": [],
    "docSubFolder": "api/",
    "merge": true,
    "externalDocPrompt": "Generate comprehensive API documentation"
  }
}
```

Key customization options:

- `internalTypeFilters`: Specify which code elements to document
- `docSubFolder`: Set the output folder for generated docs
- `merge`: Combine multiple elements into a single document
- `externalDocPrompt`: Customize the AI prompt for doc generation

The `generateBySymbols` function in `src/AiServices.ts` uses these settings to generate documentation.

## Step 3: Review and Edit

After running the command:

1. Check the `docs` folder (or your specified `docSubFolder`) for generated files
2. Review and edit the generated content as needed
3. Commit changes to your repository

By following these steps and customizing the `dev-docs.json`, you can efficiently generate and manage external documentation for your project using the VS Code extension.

  # Configuring dev-docs.json for GitHub App Documentation Generation

This guide will walk you through the process of configuring the `dev-docs.json` file to enable automatic documentation generation using the Dev-Docs GitHub App.

## Step 1: Locate the dev-docs.json file

The `dev-docs.json` file should be located in the root directory of your repository.

## Step 2: Basic Structure

Ensure your `dev-docs.json` file has the following basic structure:

```json
{
  "gitHubApp": {
    "workflows": []
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Configure Workflows

To enable documentation generation, add the `generateDocs` workflow to the `workflows` array:

```json
{
  "gitHubApp": {
    "workflows": ["generateDocs"]
  }
}
```

Note: The `workflows` array accepts specific enum values. Currently, the supported values are:

- `generateDocs`: Enables automatic documentation generation
- `generateChangelog`: Enables automatic changelog generation

## Step 4: Additional Configuration (Optional)

Depending on your project's needs, you may want to add more configuration options. For example:

```json
{
  "ai":{
    "contextDirs": ["src", "lib"],
  },
  "gitHubApp": {
    "workflows": ["generateDocs"]
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Commit and Push

After configuring your `dev-docs.json` and installing the GitHub app, commit the changes and push them to your repository.

  # Using the "Generate High Level Context for the Folder" Command

## Overview

The "Generate High Level Context for the Folder" command is a powerful feature in Dev-Docs that allows you to automatically generate high-level documentation for an entire folder in your project. This guide will walk you through how to use this command and customize its behavior using the `dev-docs.json` configuration file.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Right-Click on a Folder
In your VS Code file explorer, right-click on the folder you want to document.

### 2. Select the Command
From the context menu, choose "Generate High Level Context for the Folder".

### 3. Wait for Processing
The extension will analyze the folder contents and generate documentation. This may take a moment depending on the folder size and complexity.

### 4. Review Generated Documentation
Once complete, a new Markdown file will be created in your `dev-docs` folder, containing the high-level context for the selected folder.

## Customizing with dev-docs.json

You can customize the behavior of this command by modifying the `dev-docs.json` file in your project root. Here are some key configurations:

### 1. Customizing the Context Prompt

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "contextPrompt": "your_custom_prompt_here"
  }
}
```

This allows you to specify a custom prompt for generating the context. You can also use a Markdown file for more complex prompts:

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "contextPrompt": "dev-docs/prompt.md"
  }
}
```

### 2. Specifying Context Directories

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "contextDirs": ["src", "lib", "utils"]
  }
}
```

This limits the context generation to specific directories, which is useful for large projects.
