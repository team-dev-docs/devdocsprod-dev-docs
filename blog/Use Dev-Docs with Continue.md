\# Contextual Documentation: When Dev-Docs and Continue Had a Baby! Hey there, code wranglers! Ever felt like your documentation was as dry as a popcorn fart? Well, hold onto your keyboards because we're about to spice things up with Dev-Docs and Continue! ## Before You Get Started (Or Before You Fall Asleep) 1. Install Dev-Docs in VS Code (It's like installing a sense of humor in your IDE) 2. Install Continue in VS Code (Because coding without Continue is like trying to swim in a pool of Jell-O) ## Step 1: Open Dev-Docs and Sign In (Don't Worry, It Won't Steal Your Soul) 1. Click that shiny Dev-Docs icon in the Activity Bar. It's the one that looks like it's judging your code. 2. Sign in and create an org name. We went with "continuedev" because we're oh-so-original. ## Step 2: Set Up Your Repo (Like Setting Up a Blind Date for Your Code) 1. Hit "Setup my repo" and "Generate Context". It's like giving your code a makeover! 2. Watch in awe as a dev-docs.json file and folder magically appear. It's not sorcery, we promise. ## Step 3: Select Files and Generate Documentation (AKA: Make Your Code Talk) 1. Choose your files like you're picking players for your coding dream team. 2. Click "Generate New Doc" and voila! Your code is now more talkative than a caffeinated parrot. ## Step 4: Open Continue and Sign In (It's Like Tinder for Your Code) Sign in with GitHub. It's free! (Unlike your coffee addiction) ## Step 5: Use @dev-docs and Ask Questions (Like a Nosy Neighbor, But for Code) Try asking, "@dev-docs what technologies are used?" It's like gossip, but for nerds. ## Step 6: Customize Your Documentation (Make It as Weird as You Are) 1. Open dev-docs.json. It's your playground now! 2. Add sections, snippets, or even interpretive dance instructions. Sky's the limit! 3. Hit "Generate Context" again. It's like hitting the refresh button on your code's personality. ## Conclusion: You're Now a Documentation Wizard! Congratulations! You've successfully merged Dev-Docs and Continue. Your documentation is now so good, it might start writing itself and take over the world. But don't worry, that's a problem for future you. Happy coding, you magnificent code beast!
