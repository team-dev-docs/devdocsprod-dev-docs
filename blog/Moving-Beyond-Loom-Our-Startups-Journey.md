# Moving Beyond Loom: Our Startup's Journey

As a growing startup, we've been using Loom for our video communication needs. However, we've encountered several challenges that have led us to explore alternative solutions. In this blog post, we'll share our experience with Loom and why we're considering moving on to a more robust platform.

## The Pause and Resume Puzzle

Clear user interface and intuitive controls are crucial for any tool we use. Unfortunately, we've found the resume and pause buttons in Loom to be somewhat confusing. It's often unclear whether the recording is actually paused or still running. This lack of clarity has led to:

* Wasted time redoing recordings

* Frustration among team members

A tool that we rely on for communication should have crystal-clear controls to avoid any ambiguity.

## The Triple Recording Incident

Perhaps the most alarming issue we've encountered is the accidental creation of multiple recordings. In one instance, there was a three hour long accidental recording in our loom(luckily no views), where we able to catch it and delete it but it was still frustrating all the same:

* Lack of clear indication when a new recording starts

* No safeguards against accidental multiple recordings

* Potential for sensitive information to be unintentionally recorded and shared

This incident made us realize the importance of having a reliable and user-friendly recording process.

## The Login Barrier

Lastly, we've found the default setting of login-protected links to be a hindrance to our workflow. As a startup that frequently collaborates with external partners and clients, we need a solution that allows for easy sharing of content. Having links automatically protected by login:

* Slows down our communication process

* Creates unnecessary friction for external stakeholders

* Limits the spontaneity and ease of sharing quick updates

While we understand the importance of security, we believe there should be a more flexible approach to content sharing.

## Moving Forward

These challenges have prompted us to look for alternatives that better suit our needs. We're seeking a solution that offers:

1. A stable and reliable browser extension

2. Clear and intuitive recording controls

3. Safeguards against accidental recordings

4. Flexible sharing options

As we continue to grow and evolve, we're committed to finding tools that enhance our productivity and streamline our communication. While Loom has served us in many ways, we believe it's time to explore options that align more closely with our needs as a dynamic startup.

We're excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to finding a video communication tool that truly empowers our team and supports our growth journey.
