# Moving Beyond Loom: Our Startup's Journey

As a growing startup, we've been using Loom for our video communication needs. However, we've encountered several challenges that have led us to explore alternative solutions. In this blog post, we'll share our experience with Loom and why we're considering moving on to a more robust platform.

## The Pause and Resume Puzzle

Clear user interface and intuitive controls are crucial for any tool we use. Unfortunately, we've found the resume and pause buttons in Loom to be somewhat confusing. It's often unclear whether the recording is actually paused or still running. This lack of clarity has led to hours of wasted time redoing recordings.

## The Accidental Recording

Perhaps the most alarming issue we've encountered is the accidental creation of recordings. In one instance, there was a three hour long accidental recording in our loom(luckily no views), where we able to catch it and delete it but it was still beyond frustrating that happened in the first place.

## The Login Barrier

Lastly, we've found the default setting of login-protected links to be a hindrance to our confidence in the tool. Although the links are hard to guess because of their long randomized id, it still makes me deeply uncomfortable that all videos by default are not login protected.

## Moving Forward

I haven't been this frustated with a tool in awhile especially since I use to love loom but these challenges have prompted us to look for alternatives that better suit our needs. In this case we decided on descript.\
