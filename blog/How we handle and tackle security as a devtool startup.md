We are an AI devtool that turns code to content, and code is something we understand is something very important to users so we do no take that responsibility lightly. So you might be wondering how do we feel about security? In a word it is a top top top, and I mean top priority for us. Just for context we try to add extra security even against ourselves including additional encryption, reviewing our code to make sure we do not have security holes, and most of all reducing our visibility around things around our users info such as the code or sensitive information.\
