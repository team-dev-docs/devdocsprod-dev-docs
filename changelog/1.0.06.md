GitHub Setup"

Web App
-------

* Replaced old logos with new logo images

* Login page issue where user had to hit the login button twice

* Sometimes the GitHub Repo would be empty on installation of GitHub app so we fixed it and added refresh buttons

## Security enhancements/fixes:

## Web App

* As part of ongoing cleanup, we removed all `console.logs` including statements that could have short lived JWTs and lower permission access tokens in the browser console. These logs were only visible to the user on their own device and their browser/browser tools.

  No data was compromised, and no impact to your account or security. Just part of us tightening things up and keeping everything running safely.

## Backend Server

* Remove console.errors that was remaining in our code, that was also part of our clean up
