## Security enhancements/fixes:

## Web App

* As part of ongoing cleanup and improvements, we removed all `console.logs` including statements that could have short lived JWTs and lower permission access tokens in the browser console. These logs were only visible to the user on their own device and should not have been sent anywhere or exposed externally.

  No data was compromised, and thereâ€™s no impact to your account or security. Just part of us tightening things up and keeping everything running safely.
