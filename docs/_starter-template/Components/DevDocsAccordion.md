# Accordion Documentation

## Brief Description

Accordion is a React component that creates an expandable and collapsible accordion section, ideal for displaying content in a compact, organized manner.

## Usage

The accordion can contain any markdown content you wish to display.

## Parameters

* `title` (string, required): The text to display as the accordion's header.

* `children` (React node, required): The content to be displayed when the accordion is expanded.

## Return Value

Accordion returns a React component that renders an accordion UI element.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```jsx
<Accordion title="Click me to expand">
  This is the content that will be shown when the accordion is expanded.
  
  You can include any markdown content here.
  - List items
  - More items
  
  Or even code blocks!
</Accordion>
```

<Accordion title="Click me to expand">
  This is the content that will be shown when the accordion is expanded.
  
  You can include any markdown content here.
  - List items
  - More items
  
  Or even code blocks!
</Accordion>

## Notes or Considerations

* The accordion is collapsible by default, meaning it can be opened and closed by clicking on the title.

* Only one accordion section can be open at a time within a group of Accordion components.

* The content inside the accordion supports Markdown formatting, allowing for rich text representation.

* Ensure that the content passed to Accordion is not too lengthy, as very long content may affect user experience.

* The component automatically handles the styling and behavior of the accordion, including the expand/collapse animation.
