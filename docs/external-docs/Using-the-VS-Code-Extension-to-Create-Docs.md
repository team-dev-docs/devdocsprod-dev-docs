# Using the VS Code Extension to Create Docs

## Use the VS Code Extension to Write Normal Markdown

If you always struggled to write normal markdown, rejoice you can use Dev-Docs VS Code extension to write markdown for you! Anything written in the rich text editor as seen in the screnshot below:

To open the rich text editor just right click the markdown file file and select "Open Devdocs Markdown."

## Use the Editor to Write Docs with Dev-Docs Syntax

To get the full experience of using the VS Code Editor we recommend using the Dev-Docs markdown syntax so you can use custom styling and custom components that are only available in Dev-Docs' markdown.  To do this we add a Dev-Docs markdown wrapper and then you use the editor as seen in the screenshot below.

The <code>markdown</code> wrapper is where the extension writes all your content and the <code>parser</code> is a custom component that tells docusaurus to use the Dev-Docs Markdown and rendering.

If you ever forget how to use the Dev-Docs syntax there is a built-in VS Code extension command called <code>Use Dev Docs Syntax</code> that adds that syntax for you. See screenshot below for how to initialize the Dev-Docs Syntax.
