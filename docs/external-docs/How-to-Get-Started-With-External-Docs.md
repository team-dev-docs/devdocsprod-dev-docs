# How to Get Started With User-Facing Docs

## Intro to Dev-Docs User-Facing Documentation

At Dev-Docs we believe in documentation as code. Using Dev-Docs you can start generating user-facing documentation directly from your existing codebase. Configure what exactly you want documented and start generating first drafts of new user-facing docs in just minutes. Your docs are generated as Markdown files and live with your codebase. You always have the final say and can edit or use the Markdown files as you see fit. 

## Create Your Dev-Docs User-Facing Documentation Repo ðŸ¦¾

If you are new to Dev-Docs, just go [dev-docs.io](https://dev-docs.io) and sign up with GitHub. Click the User-facing docs tab and Dev-Docs will create a tailored made Dev-Docs GitHub repo and Dev-Docs GitHub codespace. From there you can start editing your docs! Alternatively, you can bring your existing docs repo to using Dev-Docs where your existing docs already live.
