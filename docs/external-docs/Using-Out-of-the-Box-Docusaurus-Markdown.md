# Using Out of the Box Docusaurus Markdown

## Using Docusaurus Markdown

If for some docs or pages you prefer to use the markdown/mdx functionality out the box with Docusaurus you can just add plain markdown files. Dev-Docs is built around Docusaurus, so you are not really losing any of the main Docusaurus functionality!

Checkout the core [Docusaurus Markdown Syntax](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for more info.
