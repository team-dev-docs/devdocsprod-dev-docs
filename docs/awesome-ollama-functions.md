Ollama is a powerful library for interacting with language models. Here are some of its most impressive functions:

## Core Functions

### `generate()`
- Generates text responses from prompts
- Supports streaming for real-time output
- Handles image inputs for multimodal models

### `chat()`
- Facilitates conversational interactions
- Manages message history and context
- Supports image inputs in messages

### `embed()`
- Creates vector embeddings from text input
- Useful for semantic search and text analysis

## Model Management

### `create()`
- Builds custom models from Modelfiles
- Supports quantization for optimized performance

### `pull()`
- Downloads models from the Ollama registry
- Supports progress tracking with streaming

### `push()`
- Uploads models to the Ollama registry
- Enables sharing and distribution of custom models

### `list()`
- Retrieves information about available models
- Provides details like model size and modification date

### `copy()`
- Duplicates existing models for customization
- Facilitates model versioning and experimentation

### `delete()`
- Removes models from the local system
- Helps manage storage and model versions

## Advanced Features

### `show()`
- Displays detailed metadata about a model
- Includes license, parameters, and system prompts

### `embeddings()`
- Creates vector representations of text
- Useful for semantic similarity and clustering tasks

### `parseModelfile()`
- Processes Modelfiles for custom model creation
- Handles file paths and blob hashing

These functions showcase Ollama's versatility in model interaction, management, and customization, making it a powerful tool for AI development and deployment.
