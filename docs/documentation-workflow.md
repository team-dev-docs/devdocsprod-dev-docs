# Documentation Workflow Guide

Effective documentation is crucial for project success. This guide outlines best practices for integrating documentation into your project workflow.

## 1. Set Up Your Documentation Infrastructure

* Choose a documentation tool or platform (e.g. Markdown files in version control, wiki, etc.)

* Create a dedicated docs folder in your project repository

* Set up any necessary build processes for generating docs

## 2. Integrate Documentation into Development Process

* Make documentation updates part of your Definition of Done for tasks

* Include documentation review in your code review process

* Set up automated checks to ensure docs are updated with code changes

## 3. Leverage AI-Assisted Documentation

* Use tools like Dev-Docs to generate initial documentation from your codebase

* Leverage AI to keep docs up-to-date as code changes

* Use AI-powered auditing to identify gaps or inconsistencies in docs

## 4. Establish Documentation Standards

* Create templates for common doc types (API references, tutorials, etc.)

* Define style guides for consistency across docs

* Set up linting to enforce doc standards

## 5. Implement Documentation Reviews

* Include technical writers or doc specialists in review process

* Set up dedicated documentation review meetings

* Use checklists to ensure key elements are covered

## 6. Version and Release Documentation

* Tie documentation versions to software releases

* Set up workflows to publish docs with each release

* Maintain changelogs to track doc updates

## 7. Gather Feedback and Iterate

* Set up mechanisms to collect user feedback on docs

* Regularly review and refine documentation based on feedback

* Track documentation-related metrics to measure effectiveness

By following these steps, you can create a robust documentation workflow that keeps your project docs accurate, up-to-date, and valuable for users.
