## Notes and Considerations

- Ensure that you have saved any unsaved work before opening the Dev-Docs panel, as it may change your current focus in the editor.
- The Dev-Docs panel will open in the side view by default, but this can be configured in the extension settings.
- If the Dev-Docs panel is already open, executing this command will bring it into focus.
- The first time you run this command, you may be prompted to sign in or initialize your Dev-Docs configuration.
- This command is typically used as the entry point for working with the Dev-Docs extension, so it's often one of the first commands users interact with.
