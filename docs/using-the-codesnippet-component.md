  # Using the CodeSnippet Component

The `CodeSnippet` component is a powerful tool for displaying multiple code examples in a tabbed interface within your documentation. It's particularly useful when you need to show code snippets in different languages or file types for the same concept.

## Basic Usage

To use the `CodeSnippet` component, wrap your code blocks with it in your MDX file:

<CodeSnippets>
```javascript::example.js
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```
```python::example.py
greeting = "Hello, world!"
print(greeting)
```
</CodeSnippets>

## Syntax

The syntax for each code block within the `CodeSnippet` component is:

```
```language::filename
// Your code here
```

- `language`: The programming language of the code (e.g., javascript, python, typescript)
- `filename`: The name of the file (e.g., example.js, main.py)

## Multiple Code Blocks

You can include multiple code blocks within a single `CodeSnippet` component:

<CodeSnippets>
```javascript::frontend.js
fetch('/api/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
```python::backend.py
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/data')
def get_data():
    return jsonify({"message": "Hello from the API"})
```
```html::index.html
<div id="app">
  # API Data

  ```

```

</div>

```
</CodeSnippets>

## Features

- Automatic tab creation for each code block
- Syntax highlighting based on the specified language
- File names displayed as tab labels
- Line numbers included in each code block

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive file names for better context
2. Ensure consistent indentation within code blocks
3. Keep code examples concise and focused
4. Use comments within code blocks to explain key points

By utilizing the `CodeSnippet` component, you can create more engaging and interactive documentation that allows readers to easily compare and switch between different code examples.
