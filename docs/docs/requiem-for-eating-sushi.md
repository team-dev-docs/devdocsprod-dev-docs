  # A Requiem for Eating Sushi

In the quiet hum of a dimly lit room,
We bid farewell to morsels of the sea's perfume.
Delicate slices of fish, once vibrant and new,
Now lay silent, their journey all but through.

Soy sauce pools like ink, a dark mirror's sheen,
Reflecting memories of meals that have been.
Wasabi's sharp bite, now just a ghost on the tongue,
A final whisper of flavors unsung.

Bamboo mats roll empty, their purpose complete,
No more to cradle treats both savory and sweet.
Chopsticks rest crossed, a solemn X marks the spot,
Where culinary artistry once gave all it got.

Oh, sushi, your brief life brought joy untold,
Each piece a story, each roll a tale bold.
From ocean to plate, a journey so grand,
Now ended, consumed by appreciative hands.

We mourn not just food, but a cultural embrace,
A dining experience time cannot replace.
In each bite, we tasted tradition and skill,
Now only memories, our stomachs to fill.

So we say goodbye to this feast of the sea,
To nigiri, maki, and fresh sashimi.
Though gone from our plates, in our hearts you'll remain,
Until hunger calls, and we dine once again.
