  # A Requiem for Eating Soylent

In the hushed corridors of modern efficiency,
Where time is currency and health a luxury,
Stands Soylent, a meal in powdered form,
A nutritional revolution, they say, the new norm.

Oh, how we mourned the loss of flavors divine,
The textures and aromas, no longer to shine.
Gone are the rituals of breaking bread,
Replaced by shakes, scientifically fed.

Farewell to the sizzle of bacon in the pan,
The aroma of coffee, the simple jam on hand.
No more the crunch of fresh vegetables green,
Or the sweet burst of fruit, so rarely seen.

We traded the art of cooking for convenience,
Sacrificed pleasure for supposed nutrient compliance.
But what of the joy in a shared meal's embrace?
The conversations lost in this frenzied race?

Soylent, you promised us freedom from choice,
But in doing so, you've silenced our culinary voice.
No more debates on spices or sauces to use,
Just uniformity in every bland, beige refuse.

So here we stand, at the grave of gastronomy,
Mourning dishes passed down through family.
The death of dinner, of lunch, and breakfast too,
All fallen to Soylent's efficient, flavorless brew.

Yet in this requiem, a whisper of hope remains,
For the human spirit, with its cravings, still reigns.
Perhaps one day we'll return to the stove,
And rediscover the meals that we once trove.

Until then, we'll sip our liquid sustenance,
Dreaming of flavors lost to convenience.
A toast to real food, may it one day return,
And the lessons of Soylent, may we truly learn.
