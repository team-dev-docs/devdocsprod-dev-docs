  # A Requiem for Eating Ice Cream

In the twilight of summer's embrace,
We bid farewell to frozen delight,
A melancholy ode to sweet solace,
As winter's chill looms in the night.

Oh, creamy scoops of joy untold,
Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry dreams,
Your presence in our hands we'd hold,
Now fading like sunlit gleams.

Cone or cup, it matters not,
For all too soon you'll disappear,
Leaving but memories, cold and hot,
Of flavors we held so dear.

Sprinkles fall like gentle rain,
On graves of sundaes past,
Waffle cones crack in silent pain,
As summer's treats breathe their last.

So raise your spoons in solemn toast,
To ice cream's fleeting, sugared ghost,
For though the season's end draws near,
We'll dream of scoops throughout the year.

Until spring thaws our frozen hearts,
And ice cream trucks resume their arts,
We'll mourn the loss of frosty bliss,
And count the days 'til next year's kiss.
