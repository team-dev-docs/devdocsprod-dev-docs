  # A Requiem for Eating Hot Dogs

In the annals of culinary history,
A humble food, both loved and feared,
The hot dog, once a staple treat,
Now faces a fate that's rather weird.

Oh, cylinder of mystery meat,
Nestled in your bun so sweet,
With mustard, ketchup, relish too,
Your time has come, we bid adieu.

No more at ballparks will you reign,
No picnics graced by your domain,
The health-conscious world has had its say,
And pushed our dear hot dogs away.

We mourn the loss of quick cuisine,
The ease of grabbing you between
Our busy lives and hunger pangs,
Now guilt and shame like mustard hangs.

Farewell, dear friend of summers past,
Your sizzling days could not last,
In memory, we'll hold you dear,
But on our plates, you'll disappear.

So let us raise a final bite,
To hot dogs, in their fading light,
A requiem for simpler days,
When processed food was all the craze.

Rest in peace, oh tubed delight,
In food truck heaven, shine so bright,
Your legacy will long endure,
In hearts of those who loved you pure.
