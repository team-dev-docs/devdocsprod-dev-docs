  # A Requiem for Eating Delicious Hot Yogurt

In the realm of culinary delights,
A tale unfolds of warm, creamy sights.
Hot yogurt, once a treat so rare,
Now lost to time, beyond compare.

Its tangy warmth, a comforting embrace,
A forgotten flavor, lost in time and space.
No longer do we savor its unique allure,
A culinary treasure, now obscure.

Oh, how we yearn for that silky heat,
A breakfast staple, a savory treat.
But alas, it's gone, a memory fades,
Of steaming bowls and wooden spades.

We mourn the loss of this dairy delight,
Hot yogurt, banished from our sight.
Cold and chilled, its modern kin,
Can't match the warmth that lived within.

So let us pause, and raise a spoon,
To hot yogurt, gone too soon.
A requiem for a taste divine,
Forever etched in the sands of time.

May we remember, with fond regret,
The hot yogurt we'll never forget.
A culinary chapter, now closed and done,
But in our hearts, it's never gone.
