# encodeImage Documentation

## Brief Description
`encodeImage` is a function that converts an image file to a Base64-encoded string representation.

## Usage
To use `encodeImage`, you need to import it from the module where it's defined and provide the path to the image file you want to encode.

```javascript
import { encodeImage } from './path/to/module';
```

## Parameters
- `imagePath` (string, required): The file path to the image that needs to be encoded.

## Return Value
Returns a string containing the Base64-encoded representation of the image.

## Examples

```javascript
// Example 1: Encoding a local image file
const encodedImage = encodeImage('./images/example.png');
console.log(encodedImage); // Outputs: Base64 string representation of the image

// Example 2: Using the encoded image in an HTML img tag
const imgSrc = `data:image/png;base64,${encodeImage('./logo.png')}`;
document.getElementById('myImage').src = imgSrc;
```

## Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the file path provided to `encodeImage` is correct and that the file exists.
- The function uses synchronous file reading, which may block the main thread for large files. Consider using an asynchronous version for better performance in production environments.
- The encoded string can be significantly larger than the original file size, so be mindful when working with large images or when storage/bandwidth is a concern.
- This function is useful for embedding images directly in HTML or CSS, or for sending image data over protocols that only support text.
