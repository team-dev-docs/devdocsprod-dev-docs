# Welcome to Dev-Docs

Dev-Docs is a tool to help developers more efficiently generate and maintain technical documentation. It has two main use cases:

## External Documentation (Public Facing)

External docs are meant for users, customers, developers, partners, or anyone that would use your APIs, SDKs, or applications. These docs help with developer experience and can also act as self-service implementation and support guides.

## Internal Documentation

Internal docs are meant for internal software engineering organizations, or anyone who contributes to your codebase. These docs help organizations share knowledge, maintain consistency, collaborate, and onboard new team members. This type of documentation can also be helpful in reminding developers why certain decisions were made and how the codebase works.
