# Add Team Members: The Wacky Way to Grow Your Organizational Zoo! 🐒🦁🐘

Learn how to manage your org like a circus ringmaster on a sugar rush!

## Step 1: Navigate to the User Jungle 🌴

On the homepage of the Dev-Docs web app, click "Users" or yell "TARZAN!" at your screen. Whichever works.

## Step 2: Summon the Magical Add User Genie 🧞‍♂️

Click the "Add User" button. If nothing happens, try rubbing your mouse like a magic lamp.

## Step 3: Fill in User Info (or Make It Up!) 🤪

Fill in the input fields with either: a) Actual user information b) Names of your favorite cartoon characters c) Random keyboard smashes

Click save to invite a team member to your org. Congratulations! You've just added another animal to your digital zoo!

Remember: The more users you add, the more fun your office becomes. It's like playing "The Floor is Lava," but with deadlines!
