# How to Expand Your Circus: Adding New Clowns to the Big Top

Ever felt like your organization needs more jesters? Well, buckle up, ringmaster, because we're about to teach you how to recruit some fresh faces for your digital three-ring circus!

## Step 1: Embark on a User Safari

First things first, brave explorer! Navigate to the exotic land of "Users" on your Dev-Docs homepage. It's like a virtual savannah, but with fewer lions and more avatars.

## Step 2: Summon the Magical Add User Dialog

Click that shiny "Add User" button like it's a big red nose. Go on, give it a honk! This will conjure the mystical Add User Dialog, guaranteed to be 73% less confusing than assembling IKEA furniture.

## Step 3: Fill in the Blanks (or Risk Cosmic Chaos)

Now, channel your inner bureaucrat and fill in those input fields. Remember, every blank left unfilled creates a tear in the space-time continuum. Or, you know, just makes HR grumpy. Click save to officially invite your new team member to join your merry band of keyboard warriors!

Congratulations! You've successfully expanded your digital circus. May your new recruit bring you joy, efficiency, and only the occasional pratfall.
