# Add Wacky Team Members: A Zany Guide to Org Management 🎭

## Step 1: Navigate to the Land of Users 🧭

On the homepage of the Dev-Docs web app, do a silly dance and then click "Users" with your nose.

## Step 2: Summon the Magical Add User Dialog 🧙‍♂️

Wave your arms like a wild octopus and shout "Abracadabra!" Then, click the "Add User" button with your elbow.

## Step 3: Fill in User Info (But Make It Funky) 🕺

Fill in the input fields using only words that rhyme with "banana." When you're done, do the Macarena and click save to invite a team member to your org. Congratulations, you've just added a new wacky member to your circus... I mean, organization!
