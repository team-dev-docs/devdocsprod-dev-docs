# Getting Started with Dev-Docs

Dev-Docs is a powerful documentation platform that helps developers efficiently generate, query, and search documentation using AI. With Dev-Docs, you can create and maintain high-quality documentation for both internal and external audiences.

## External Documentation (Public-Facing)

External documentation is intended for users, customers, developers, partners, or anyone who will use your APIs, SDKs, or applications. These docs help improve the developer experience and act as self-service implementation and support guides.

## Internal Documentation

Internal documentation is designed for internal software engineering teams or anyone who contributes to your codebase. This type of documentation helps organizations share knowledge, maintain consistency, collaborate effectively, and onboard new team members. It can also serve as a reminder of why certain decisions were made and how the codebase works.

With Dev-Docs, you can streamline the documentation process, ensure consistency, and keep your documentation up-to-date with your codebase. Get started today and experience the power of AI-assisted documentation!
