# Dev-Docs.JSON Configuration

The `dev-docs.json` file is a configuration file used by the Dev-Docs extension to customize various aspects of its behavior, such as documentation generation, AI integration, and code analysis. It follows the JSON format and adheres to a predefined schema.  For most commands configuration is optional but recommended.

## `quickDoc` Object

The `quickDoc` object in the JSON schema defines configuration options related to generating quick documentation for variables and functions.
