  # Using the Chrome Extension

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to install the Dev-Docs Chrome extension from the following link:

<br></br>

[Chrome Extension Link Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jdfpljfedojaigjibfnnobbmgmlfkibb)

<br></br>
This extension will allow you to capture screenshots and generate markdown documentation as you navigate through your UI browser workflows, for example your own app and UI. You can open the extension on a MAC with shift command U, or you can click on the extension icon and hit open panel (we're working on making this more intuitive in future updates).
<br></br>
After you sign in with GitHub, make sure you select your org.

Also make sure you have created a Dev-Docs account. You can find a guide [here](/docs/Onboarding/Create an Account and Org.md). 

After that, go to [this page](https://www.dev-docs.io/user-facing_docs) to confirm you are all set up. If you see a GitHub URL and org, then you're good to go.

<br></br>

Optionally, if you want to set up the chrome extension to push to your custom repo, you can set it up [here](/docs/Integrate Dev-Docs with a Custom Docs Repo.md). However, we recommend starting simple first to get familiar with the process.

## Step 1: Hit Record

Now it's time to record. Before you start, you can toggle whether to capture images or not. When you're ready, hit the record button to start documenting a workflow. You'll see a few options:

<br></br>
- Topic (Required): This is a mandatory field that serves as the title of your guide. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
- Writing Persona (Optional): This field allows you to customize the writer/writing style. For example, you could specify "technical writer" for a professional tone, "beginner-friendly explainer" for simpler language, or even "poet" for a more creative approach.
<br></br>
<br></br>
- Additional Context (Optional): Think of this as extra instructions or context to help Dev-Docs write your guide more accurately.

## Step 2: Click through workflow

From here, just proceed with your typical workflow as usual. The extension will capture the necessary information in the background.

## Step 3: Reopen the Extension

When you're done, hit Shift Command U again and click "Generate Guide". Please note that it may take some time to process and generate the content.

## Step 4: View Results and Update Docs

You'll now see a dialog with the output of the guide. Review the content carefully, and when you're satisfied, click "Update Docs" to merge the guide as a markdown file into your repo.

## Step 5: Refine and Collaborate

After pushing your new guide to the repo, it's a good practice to review it in the context of your existing documentation. You may want to:

- Check for consistency in terminology and style
- Add cross-references to related guides or topics
- Solicit feedback from team members or end-users
- Iterate and improve based on real-world usage

Remember, great documentation is an ongoing process. Regular updates and refinements will ensure your guides remain valuable and up-to-date for all users.
