# Quickstart

Welcome to Docs.dev! Follow the steps below to get started in ***under 5 minutes***.

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub account is required for authenticating with [Docs.dev](http://Docs.dev)

* A documentation repo in GitHub. If you do not have one, go [here](/docs/editor/connect-the-starter-template-to-the-ai-editor) and follow the guide to set up a new docs repo using our open source Docusaurus template

## Create account

Go to [app.docs.dev](http://app.docs.dev) and log in with GitHub to create your account and create an org within Docs.dev.

## Setup and connect your docs repo

Click setup to go through the onboarding and either connect your existing docs repo in GitHub. If you do not have an existing docs repo, you can either create one yourself and connect it or leverage our open source Docusaurus template.

### Connect your existing docs

Select **Connect your own docs** to set up Docs.dev to work with your existing documentation. You will be taken to GitHub to install our GitHub App and will need to connect it to your documentation repo. You will need the repository owner to approve the request if you lack the permissions needed to install GitHub Apps on your repo.

We recommend you start by providing access to only the repo where your docs are hosted from to start. You can always come back and connect additional repos that you would like to use as context at a later time (i.e. public SDKs or codebases) in order to take full advantage of Docs.dev.

Once you have installed the GitHub App and selected which repo(s) to connect, come back to [app.docs.dev](https://app.docs.dev/) and close the loop by inputting which repo your documentation lives in. Congrats! Now you're all set up and ready to go! Select **Edit docs** to open up the web editor and get going.

See [here](/docs/editor/connect-existing-docs-repo-to-editor) for a step by step guide on connecting your existing docs.
