# Best Practices for Using Dev-Docs Effectively

## 1. Leverage AI-Generated Documentation

- Use the "Generate Documentation" command (Shift+Cmd+D or Shift+Ctrl+D) to quickly create initial documentation for code files.
- Review and edit the AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and add additional context where needed.

## 2. Customize Configuration

- Tailor the `dev-docs.json` file to your project's specific needs:
  - Use `internalTypeFilters` to focus on relevant code elements
  - Set appropriate `codeFilters` and `nameFilters` to target specific patterns or functions
  - Customize the `contextPrompt` for more targeted AI-generated content

## 3. Maintain Consistency

- Use the "Generate High Level Context for the Folder" command to create overviews of project structure.
- Regularly run the "Find Missing Documentation" command to identify and fill documentation gaps.

## 4. Integrate with Workflow

- Enable Markdown mode for in-editor documentation to keep docs close to the code.
- Use the "Populate External Docs" command to generate and update user-facing documentation.

## 5. Leverage Context-Aware Features

- Utilize the "Ask Dev-Docs A Question" command to get AI-powered answers about your codebase.
- Generate API documentation automatically to keep it in sync with your code.

## 6. Collaborate Effectively

- Use the GitHub App integration to automate documentation generation in your CI/CD pipeline.
- Sync your Dev-Docs to Dev-Docs Cloud for easier team collaboration and accessibility.

## 7. Regular Maintenance

- Set up a schedule to review and update documentation, especially after major code changes.
- Use the auditing features to ensure documentation quality and completeness over time.

By following these best practices, you can maximize the benefits of Dev-Docs and maintain high-quality, up-to-date documentation for your projects.
