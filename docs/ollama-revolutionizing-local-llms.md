## Spotlight on SDK Features

Ollama's JavaScript SDK offers a rich set of features that make integrating LLMs into your applications a breeze:

### 1. Streamable Responses

The SDK supports streamable responses, allowing for real-time generation of content:

```javascript
const response = await ollama.generate({
  model: 'llama2',
  prompt: 'Tell me a story',
  stream: true
});

for await (const part of response) {
  console.log(part.response);
}
```

### 2. Multi-Modal Capabilities

Ollama supports multi-modal inputs, including images:

```javascript
const response = await ollama.generate({
  model: 'llava',
  prompt: 'Describe this image',
  images: [imageBuffer]
});
```

### 3. Model Management

Easily manage your models with built-in functions:

```javascript
await ollama.pull({ model: 'llama2' });
await ollama.push({ model: 'my-custom-model' });
await ollama.create({
  model: 'my-new-model',
  path: './my-modelfile'
});
```

### 4. Embeddings Generation

Generate embeddings for text analysis and similarity searches:

```javascript
const response = await ollama.embeddings({
  model: 'llama2',
  prompt: 'Understand the context'
});
```

### 5. Flexible Configuration

Customize your Ollama instance with various options:

```javascript
const customOllama = new Ollama({
  host: 'http://localhost:11434',
  headers: { 'Custom-Header': 'Value' }
});
```
