### Step 1: Access your codebase
Open your codebase in Visual Studio Code and navigate to the file or directory you want to document.

### Step 2: Open the Command Palette
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code.

### Step 3: Search for the "Generate Documentation" command
In the Command Palette, start typing "Generate Documentation" and select the "devdocs.generateDocumentation" command.

### Step 4: Configure the Documentation Generation
In the `dev-docs.json` file, you can configure various options to customize the documentation generation process. For example, you can specify the types of code elements to include, filter code patterns, and set the output location for the generated documentation.

### Step 5: Generate the Documentation
After selecting the "devdocs.generateDocumentation" command, the extension will analyze your codebase and generate comprehensive documentation based on your configuration settings.

### Step 6: Review and Refine the Documentation
The generated documentation will be saved in the specified location (e.g., `docPath` or `docSubFolder`). Review the generated documentation and make any necessary adjustments or additions to ensure it meets your requirements.

By following these steps, you can leverage the power of AI to automate the documentation process, saving time and effort while ensuring your documentation remains accurate, consistent, and up-to-date with your codebase.
