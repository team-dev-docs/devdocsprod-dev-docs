   - Generates high-level context summaries for folders and files
   - Helps new team members quickly understand project structure

9. **SEO and Sales Benefits**
   - Improves search engine visibility of your project
   - Enhances user experience, potentially boosting adoption and sales

10. **Continuous Documentation**
    - Integrates with GitHub App for automatic documentation updates
