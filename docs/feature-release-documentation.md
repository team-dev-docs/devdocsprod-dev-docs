# Guidelines for Documenting New Feature Releases

To ensure consistent and timely documentation for new feature releases, follow these guidelines:

1. Start documentation early in the development process
   - Create a draft doc as soon as feature planning begins
   - Update iteratively as the feature evolves

2. Include key information:
   - Feature overview and purpose  
   - How to enable/configure the feature
   - Usage instructions with examples
   - Any limitations or known issues
   - Links to related docs/features

3. Use clear, concise language
   - Avoid jargon and explain technical terms
   - Use active voice and direct instructions

4. Add visuals where helpful
   - Screenshots of UI elements
   - Diagrams for complex workflows
   - Code snippets for developer docs

5. Have docs reviewed by:
   - Feature developers
   - Technical writers 
   - Users unfamiliar with the feature

6. Publish docs alongside the feature release
   - Coordinate timing with product/engineering teams
   - Announce in release notes with link to full docs

7. Monitor and update post-release
   - Address any user questions/feedback
   - Keep docs updated as the feature evolves

Following these guidelines will help ensure comprehensive, high-quality documentation is available to users with each new feature release.
