## Step 11: Associate your repository with your Dev-Docs organization

## Step 12: Set your documentation repository in Dev-Docs

![Set documentation repo](/img/connect_the_starter_template_to_the_ai_editor/step_25.png)

You should now see a dialog that prompts you to select your documentation repo. Make sure to select the one we set up from the dropdown. This tells Dev-Docs where your docs will live and where the Dev-Docs editor should connect.

## Step 13: Open the AI editor for your new docs

![Open AI editor](/img/starter_template_edit_docs.png)

You'll now have access to the AI editor interface where you can start creating and editing your documentation.

## Step 14: Push changes to GitHub repository

![Push to GitHub](/img/connect_the_starter_template_to_the_ai_editor/step_28.png)

After making changes in the AI editor, use the interface to push your updates to the GitHub repository, ensuring your documentation stays in sync.

## Step 15: Review and manage your documentation

Take some time to review the initial documentation structure provided by the starter template. You can now use the AI editor to:

- Update existing content
- Add new pages or sections
- Reorganize the documentation structure
- Collaborate with team members on documentation tasks

Remember to regularly commit and push your changes to keep your documentation up-to-date and accessible to your team or users.
