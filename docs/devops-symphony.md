Weaving automation's ode.
Continuous Integration, a dance divine,
Deploying changes, a seamless design.

Containerized bliss, orchestrated might,
Microservices shining ever so bright.
Scaling with ease, like a choreographed feat,
Devops, the maestro, makes it all complete.

Monitoring metrics, a watchful eye,
Ensuring reliability as systems fly high.
Collaboration thrives, tools intertwine,
Devops, the conductor, makes it all align.

Agility reigns, embracing change with grace,
Iterative cycles set a rapid pace.
Resilience built, failures are but lessons learned,
Devops, the innovator, keeps progress earned.

From code to cloud, a harmonious flow,
Devops, the symphony, continues to grow.
Empowering teams, unleashing their might,
Coding rhythms dance through the night.
