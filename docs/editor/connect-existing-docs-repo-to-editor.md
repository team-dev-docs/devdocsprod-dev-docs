## Step 2: Set up User-Facing Docs by installing the GitHub App

To use your existing docs, select **Connect your own docs** and click on Install the GitHub App to begin the integration process. Clicking this will take you out of Docs.dev and into your GitHub where you can install and set up the Dev-Docs GitHub App.

## Step 6: Associate your repository with your Dev-Docs organization

## Step 7: Set your documentation repo in Dev-Docs

You should now see a dialog prompting you to select your documentation repository. Choose the one we set up from the dropdown. This step informs Docs.dev where your documentation lives and where the Docs.dev editor should pull from. Once this step is done you're all set and ready to go!
