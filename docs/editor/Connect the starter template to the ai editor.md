# Connect the starter template to the AI editor

## Step 1: Generate Starter template docs

When first setting up your [Docs.dev](http://Docs.dev) account you will be prompted to set up your docs. To use your existing docs, select **Connect your own docs** and click on "install the GitHub App" to begin the integration process. Clicking this will take you out of [Docs.dev](http://Docs.dev) and into your GitHub where you can install and set up the Dev-Docs GitHub app.

On the GitHub page, click on "New repository" to create a new repository for your documentation.

## Step 4: Set up the repository details

Fill in the repository details:

* Choose the repository template (e.g., team-dev-docs/starter-template-v3)

* Set the owner

* Name your repository (e.g., my\_cool\_new\_docs)

* Choose visibility (public or private)

Click "Create repository" when done.

## Step 5: View the newly created repository

## Step 6: Return to Dev-Docs to connect your new docs

Back in Dev-Docs, you'll see a prompt to set up your docs. Click "Connect your own docs" to proceed.

## Step 7: Set up User-Facing Docs by installing GitHub App

Click on "install the GitHub App" to begin the connection process.

## Step 8: Confirm repository selection for GitHub App

Click "install" or "Configure" if you have installed the app already.

## Step 9: Select your GitHub account or organization

![Select GitHub account](/img/connect_the_starter_template_to_the_ai_editor/step_16.png)

Select the GitHub account or organization where you want to install the app.

## Step 10: Add the documentation repository

![Add docs repo](/img/connect_the_starter_template_to_the_ai_editor/step_17.png)

From the dropdown, select the docs repo we created in the prior steps. Be sure to select it and click "save".

## Step 11: Associate your repository with your Dev-Docs organization

![Associate repo with Dev-Docs org](/img/connect_the_starter_template_to_the_ai_editor/step_22.png)

Check to make sure your repo name matches your desired Dev-Docs organization and click "complete GitHub App Setup".

## Step 12: Set your documentation repository in Dev-Docs

![Set documentation repo](/img/connect_the_starter_template_to_the_ai_editor/step_25.png)

You should now see a dialog that prompts you to select your documentation repo. Make sure to select the one we set up from the dropdown. This tells Dev-Docs where your docs will live and where the Dev-Docs editor should connect.

## Step 13: Open the AI editor for your new docs

![Open AI editor](/img/starter_template_edit_docs.png)

You'll now have access to the AI editor interface where you can start creating and editing your documentation.

## Step 14: Push changes to GitHub repository

![Push to GitHub](/img/connect_the_starter_template_to_the_ai_editor/step_28.png)

After making changes in the AI editor, use the interface to push your updates to the GitHub repository, ensuring your documentation stays in sync.

## Step 15: Review and manage your documentation

Take some time to review the initial documentation structure provided by the starter template. You can now use the AI editor to:

* Update existing content

* Add new pages or sections

* Reorganize the documentation structure

* Collaborate with team members on documentation tasks

Remember to regularly commit and push your changes to keep your documentation up-to-date and accessible to your team or users.
