# Connect the starter template to the AI editor

## Step 1: Generate Starter template docs

When first setting up your Docs.dev account you will be prompted to set up your docs. If you don't have a documentation repo and you would like use our starter template, select Use our template. Clicking this will take you out of Docs.dev and into your GitHub where you can install and set up the Dev-Docs GitHub app.
