## Step 6: Confirm the Change
After renaming, verify that the new name appears correctly in the drafts list. If needed, you can repeat the process to make further adjustments.

Your draft has now been renamed. The new name will be displayed in the drafts list, making it easier to organize and locate your documents.

**Note:** Renaming a draft does not affect its content or version history. It simply changes how the draft is identified in your list of documents.
