# Security Best Practices for Documentation Management

## Access Control
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g. multi-factor authentication) for accessing documentation systems
- Use role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive documents
- Regularly audit and review user access permissions

## Data Protection  
- Encrypt sensitive documentation, both in transit and at rest
- Back up documentation regularly and store backups securely
- Implement data loss prevention tools to prevent unauthorized sharing of sensitive docs

## Secure Development
- Follow secure coding practices when developing documentation tools/platforms
- Perform regular security testing and vulnerability scans
- Keep all software and dependencies up-to-date with security patches

## Monitoring and Incident Response
- Implement logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activities
- Develop and maintain an incident response plan for documentation-related security incidents
- Conduct regular security awareness training for all users of the documentation system

## Compliance
- Ensure documentation practices comply with relevant regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA)
- Implement appropriate data retention and deletion policies
- Maintain an audit trail of all access and changes to sensitive documents

## Third-Party Risk Management
- Evaluate the security practices of any third-party documentation tools or services
- Implement appropriate controls when sharing documentation with external parties
- Regularly review third-party access and revoke when no longer needed
