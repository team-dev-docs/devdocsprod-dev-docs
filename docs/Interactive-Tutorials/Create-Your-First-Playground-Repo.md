Once in your Playground Repository, you'll see a list of example files. These files serve as templates for your live code examples. You can edit these files directly in the browser or clone the repository to your local machine for more extensive changes.

Remember, any changes you make to the files in this repository will be reflected in your live playground examples. This allows you to keep your documentation up-to-date with the latest code samples and examples.
