## Intro to Dev-Docs External Documentation

At Dev-Docs, we believe in documentation as code.  We are built around a very popular markdown documentation framework from Meta called Docusaurus.  With Dev-Docs though we give your documentation site super powers and make documentation more accessible for non-js developers.

## Create your Dev-Docs external documentation Repo 🦾

If you are new to Dev-Docs, just go [https://dev-docs.io](https://dev-docs.io) and sign up with Github.  Hit the button called External Docs, and Dev-Docs will create a tailored made Dev-Docs Github repo and Dev-Docs Github codespace.  From there you can start editing your docs!  Super Rad!
