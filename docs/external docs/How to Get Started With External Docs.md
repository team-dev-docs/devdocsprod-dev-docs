## Intro to Dev-Docs External Documentation

At Dev-Docs we believe in documentation as code. The Dev-Docs powered external, public facing, docs site is built around a popular markdown documentation framework from Meta called Docusaurus. With Dev-Docs your documentation site gets super powers and becomes more accessible for non-js developers.

## Create Your Dev-Docs External Documentation Repo 🦾

If you are new to Dev-Docs, just go [dev-docs.io](https://dev-docs.io) and sign up with Github. Click the External Docs button and Dev-Docs will create a tailored made Dev-Docs Github repo and Dev-Docs Github codespace. From there you can start editing your docs! Super rad!
