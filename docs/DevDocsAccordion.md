  return (
    <DevDocsAccordion title="Section Title">
      {/* Your content here */}
    </DevDocsAccordion>
  );
}
```

## Parameters

- `title` (string, required): The text to display as the accordion's header.
- `children` (React node, required): The content to be displayed when the accordion is expanded.

## Return Value
DevDocsAccordion returns a React component that renders an accordion UI element.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```jsx
<DevDocsAccordion title="Getting Started">
  <p>This is the content of the accordion. It can include any valid JSX.</p>
</DevDocsAccordion>
```

### With Multiple Paragraphs
```jsx
<DevDocsAccordion title="Advanced Topics">
  <p>First paragraph of content.</p>
  <p>Second paragraph with more details.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
  </ul>
</DevDocsAccordion>
```

## Notes or Considerations

- The accordion is collapsible by default, meaning it can be opened and closed by clicking on the title.
- Only one accordion section can be open at a time within a group of DevDocsAccordion components.
- The content inside the accordion supports Markdown formatting, allowing for rich text representation.
- Ensure that the content passed to DevDocsAccordion is not too lengthy, as very long content may affect user experience.
- The component automatically handles the styling and behavior of the accordion, including the expand/collapse animation.
