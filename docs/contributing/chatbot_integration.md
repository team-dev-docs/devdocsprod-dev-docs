The AI chatbot feature provides an interactive way for users to get information from your documentation. This guide covers how to implement and customize the chatbot's behavior and appearance.

## Implementation

The chatbot is implemented in the `DocChat.jsx` component. Key aspects of the implementation include:

- Using the `useState` hook to manage the chat state (messages, input, etc.)
- Fetching responses from an AI backend API 
- Rendering chat messages and UI elements
- Handling user input and sending messages

## Customizing Behavior

### Modifying the Chat API

To change the AI backend used by the chatbot:

1. Update the `chatUrl` variable in `chat.json` to point to your desired API endpoint
2. Modify the `handleSendMessage` function in `DocChat.jsx` to match the request/response format of your API

### Adjusting Message Handling

To customize how messages are processed and displayed:

1. Edit the `handleSendMessage` function to change how user messages are handled
2. Modify the message rendering logic in the JSX to change how messages appear

## Customizing Appearance

### Styling

The chatbot's styles are defined in `chatbot.scss`. Key areas to modify include:

- `.chat-box` - Overall chatbot container
- `.chat-box__messages` - Message display area
- `.chat-box__message` - Individual message bubbles
- `.chat-box__input` - Message input field

### Layout

To adjust the chatbot's layout:

1. Modify the JSX structure in `DocChat.jsx`
2. Update corresponding styles in `chatbot.scss`

### Avatar

To change the chatbot's avatar:

1. Replace the `logo` image in `logo.json`
2. Or modify the `SvgBackgroundImage` component to use a different image source

## Advanced Customization

For more extensive customization:

- Add new state variables and functions to `DocChat.jsx` to implement additional features
- Create new subcomponents to modularize complex UI elements
- Extend the chat message format to include new types of content or metadata

Remember to test thoroughly after making changes to ensure the chatbot continues to function correctly across different devices and scenarios.
