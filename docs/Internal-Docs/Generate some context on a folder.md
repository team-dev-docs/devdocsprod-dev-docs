## Step 1: Open the Folder in VS Code

First, open your project folder in Visual Studio Code. You should see the folder structure in the Explorer pane on the left side of the window. In this example, we can see a Node.js project with various files and folders.

## Step 2: Generate High Level Context for the Folder

1. Right-click on the folder you want to generate context for in the Explorer pane.
2. In the context menu that appears, scroll down to the bottom.
3. Click on the option "Generate High Level Context for the Folder".

This action will create a high-level context document for the selected folder, providing an overview of its contents and structure. The generated context can be useful for understanding the project layout and main components at a glance.

## Step 3: Review the Generated Context

After initiating the context generation, VS Code will process the folder's contents and create a summary. This may take a few moments depending on the size and complexity of your project.

Once complete, a new file will open in the editor, displaying the generated context. This document typically includes:

- An overview of the folder structure
- A list of key files and their purposes
- Information about configuration files
- Details on dependencies and external libraries
- Any notable patterns or architectural choices

Review this information to quickly get up to speed on the project's organization and main components.

## Step 4: Save and Share the Context

The generated context can be a valuable resource for team collaboration and onboarding new developers. Consider saving this file within your project repository or sharing it with team members to enhance project understanding and documentation.
