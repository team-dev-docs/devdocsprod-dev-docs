# Generate Documentation with AI

Out of the box, Dev-Docs will document your codebase by letting you know what each function, class, or variable does on a case by base basis. Below you'll see a step by step guide on how to start generating docs from your VS Code editor.

## Step 1: Sign into Dev-Docs in VS Code

In your VS Code Editor, click on the Dev-Docs button.

## Step 3: Run the AI on Code File of Choice

Select the file you wish to be documented. From there, open the command palette, search and select **dev-docs: generate documentation** or run <code>shift command d</code>.

## Step 4: Review the AI Generated Documentation

In just a few minutes you'll see a new Markdown file generated in the Dev-Docs folder in your repo. You can view the raw Markdown there or right click on the file you generated docs for and navigate to **Open Devdocs Markdown** to view it in a rich text editor right next to the file itself.
