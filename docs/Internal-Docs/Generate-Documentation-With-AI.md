# Generate documentation with AI

Out of the box, Dev-Docs will document your codebase by letting you know what each function, class, or variable does on a case by case basis. Below you'll see a step by step guide on how to start generating docs from your VS Code editor.

## Step 1: Sign into Dev-Docs in VS Code

In your VS Code Editor, click on the Dev-Docs button.

## Step 3: Run the AI on Code File of Choice

Select the file you wish to be documented. From there, open the command palette, search and select **dev-docs: generate documentation** or run <code>shift command d</code>.

## Step 4: Review the AI Generated Documentation

In just a few minutes you'll see a new Markdown file generated in the Dev-Docs folder in your repo. You can view the raw Markdown there or right click on the file you generated docs for and navigate to **Open Devdocs Markdown** to view it in a rich text editor right next to the file itself.

## Step 5: Customize AI Generation

Dev-Docs allows you to customize the AI generation process to better suit your project's needs. You can adjust the documentation style, depth of analysis, and even provide custom prompts to guide the AI in generating more relevant documentation.

To customize the AI generation:

1. Open the Dev-Docs settings in VS Code.
2. Navigate to the "AI Generation" section.
3. Modify the parameters such as "Documentation Style" or "Analysis Depth".
4. Save your changes and regenerate the documentation to see the results.

By fine-tuning these settings, you can ensure that the generated documentation aligns perfectly with your project's requirements and coding standards.
