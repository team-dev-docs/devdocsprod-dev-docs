## Step 5: Customize AI-Generated Documentation

After the AI generates the initial documentation, you may want to customize it further:

1. Open the generated markdown file in VS Code.
2. Review the content for accuracy and completeness.
3. Add any additional context or explanations that might be helpful for your team.
4. Format the documentation to match your team's style guide if necessary.

## Step 6: Integrate with Version Control

To ensure your AI-generated documentation stays up-to-date with your codebase:

1. Commit the generated markdown files to your version control system (e.g., Git).
2. Create a process for regularly updating the documentation when code changes occur.
3. Consider setting up automated documentation generation as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

By following these additional steps, you can maximize the value of AI-generated documentation in your development workflow.
