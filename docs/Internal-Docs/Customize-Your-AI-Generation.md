## Step 4: Customize the JSON

Now we are going to make your Dev-Docs JSON look similar to the one in the step above. The goal is have the AI answer custom questions and prompts on our code. Replace your JSON with JSON below:

```json

{
    "quickDoc": {
        "acceptedExtensions": [".js", ".py"],
        "variablesAndFunctions": {
            "prompts": [
                {
                    "question": "Is this a function, class, or variable",
                    "title": "Code Type",
                    "documentation": ""
                },
                {
                    "question": "Is this code written well? If so why?",
                    "title": "Quality of Code",
                    "documentation": ""
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "ai": {
        "onSave": true
    }
}

```

You can then customize the questions you want the AI To answer from your code by adusting the questions in the JSON or adding new ones to the JSON. The title can be thought of as a header within your documentation. Here you can also set the AI to run every time you save by keeping the "onSave" prompt as true. Alternatively, you can turn the auto generate on save feature off by setting the "onSave" prompt to false.

## Step 5: Run the AI on Code File of Choice

Make sure you are signed in and then select the file you wish to be documented. From there, open the command palette, search and select **dev-docs: generate documentation** or run <code>shift command d</code>.
