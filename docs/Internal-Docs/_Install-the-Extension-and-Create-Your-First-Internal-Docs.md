## Step 3: Initialize your codebase

Open the command palette with `shift command p` and click/select: dev-docs: Initialize Dev-Docs. This creates a `dev-docs.json` file that you can use to configure Dev-Docs.

Now we are going to create our first dev-docs documents but since we aren't using dev-docs cloud yet, we are going to turn on markdown mode. Open the command palette with `shift command p` and search for the text that says "dev-docs: turn on markdown mode."

## Step 5: Edit your first general document

The Dev-Docs text editor should open to the general document for your codebase that covers a general overview of the codebase.

Feel free to start typing and it will autosave to Dev-Docs. You can use this space to provide an overview of your project, its main components, and any important architectural decisions.

## Step 6: Edit your first document tied to code

You can also create documentation tied to any specific code files. To do this, right click on any codefile and select **open Dev-doc for current file**.

When documenting specific files, consider including information about the file's purpose, any important functions or classes it contains, and how it interacts with other parts of your codebase.

## Step 7: Done

Now any documentation created by Dev-Docs will be saved as markdown in the Dev-Docs folder. This allows for easy version control and collaboration with your team members.

Remember to keep your documentation up-to-date as your project evolves. Regular updates will ensure that your team always has access to accurate and relevant information about your codebase.
