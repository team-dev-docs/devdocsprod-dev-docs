A new panel will appear on the right side of the editor titled "Your Dev-Docs". Here, you can select the files you want to use as context for generating documentation. The image shows several files already selected, including index.js, package.json, test.js, and tests/removeBackground.test.js. You can add or remove files from this selection as needed.
