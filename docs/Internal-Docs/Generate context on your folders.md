In the context menu, scroll down until you see the option "Generate High Level Context for the Folder". Click on this option to start the context generation process for the selected folder.

After completing these steps, the Dev-Docs extension will analyze the contents of the folder and generate a high-level context document, which can be useful for understanding the structure and purpose of the files within that folder.
