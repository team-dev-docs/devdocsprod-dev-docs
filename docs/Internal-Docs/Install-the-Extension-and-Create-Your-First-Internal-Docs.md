Feel Free to start typing and it will autosave to Dev-Docs. Consider adding information about project setup, coding standards, and important architectural decisions to help new team members get up to speed quickly.

## Step 6: Edit Your First Onboarding Document Tied to Code

You can also create onboarding documentation tied to any specific code files. This is particularly useful for explaining complex components or critical parts of your codebase. To do this, right click on any codefile and select **open Dev-doc for current file**.

## Step 7: Organize Your Onboarding Docs

Now any documentation created by Dev-Docs will be saved as markdown in the Dev-Docs folder. Consider creating a structured hierarchy for your onboarding docs, such as "Getting Started", "Code Structure", "Development Workflow", and "Troubleshooting" to make it easier for new team members to navigate.
