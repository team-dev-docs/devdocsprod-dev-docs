## Step 1: Open the Code File

Open your code file in your preferred IDE or text editor. In this example, we're using Visual Studio Code with a dark theme. The file open is `index.js`, which contains JavaScript code for image processing.

## Step 2: Access the Context Menu

Right-click anywhere in the code editor to bring up the context menu. In the menu, you'll see various options for working with your code. Look for the "Dev-Docs" option, which is highlighted in the image.

## Step 3: Generate Context

From the "Dev-Docs" submenu, select "Generate Context". This will trigger the process of analyzing your code and generating contextual information about the file and its contents.

## Step 4: Review Generated Context

Once the context generation is complete, a new panel or window will open displaying the generated context. This may include:

- An overview of the file's purpose
- Key functions or classes defined in the file
- Dependencies and imports
- Any notable algorithms or patterns used

Take some time to review this information to gain a deeper understanding of your code.

## Step 5: Save or Share Context

Many context generation tools allow you to save the generated information or share it with team members. Look for options to export the context as a markdown file or integrate it with your project's documentation system.

By following these steps, you can easily generate and utilize context for your code file, which can be helpful for documentation, understanding complex codebases, or sharing information with team members.
