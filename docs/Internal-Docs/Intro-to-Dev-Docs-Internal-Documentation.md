# Intro to Dev-Docs Internal Documentation

Internal Documentation refers to documentation intended for your own teams. This can be applied to any project, whether it be for an open source project, a team, a department, or a whole company. Dev-Docs will generate Markdown files for you with no configuration needed. However, you do have the ability to configure exactly what you want with the `dev-docs.json`. This includes what code you want documented, what questions you want answered of your code, and if you want it pushed to any external source (Confluence, Notion, or Google Drive).

Whether you need documentation to help onboard new hires, for devs contributing to your codebase or to keep the broader organization up to date, Dev-Docs has your back. This section will break down how to start generating docs for your team and how to configure exactly what you want documented.
