  # Generate Context on a Codefile

## Step 1

Open your project in the code editor. Navigate to the file you want to generate context for in the file explorer on the left side. In this example, we're looking at 'index.js'.

On the right side of the editor, you'll see a panel with various options. Look for the "Dev-Docs" section, which shows you're signed in to "devdocsprod". Make sure the "Include Images" toggle is switched on.

## Step 2

Right-click anywhere in the code file to bring up the context menu. Scroll down to find and hover over the "Dev-Docs" option.

From the submenu that appears, select "Generate Context" to create context for the current file. This will analyze your code and generate relevant documentation or context information based on its content.

By following these steps, you can easily generate context for your code files, which can be helpful for documentation and understanding the structure and purpose of your code.
