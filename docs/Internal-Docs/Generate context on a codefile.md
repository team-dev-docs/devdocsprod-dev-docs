Open the codefile you want to generate context for in your code editor. In this example, we're using Visual Studio Code with a dark theme. The file open is `index.js`, which contains JavaScript code for image processing.

## Step 2: Access the context menu

Right-click anywhere in the code editor to bring up the context menu. In the menu, you'll see various options for interacting with your code.

## Step 3: Select "Generate Context"

In the context menu, navigate to the "Dev-Docs" submenu. From there, select the "Generate Context" option. This will initiate the process of generating context for your codefile, which can be useful for documentation and understanding the code structure.

By following these steps, you can easily generate context for your codefile, enhancing your development workflow and improving code comprehension.
