# Replace Selected Text with AI-Generated Content

## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command allows you to select text within an open file in Visual Studio Code and replace it with content generated by an AI service. When you trigger this command, it will prompt you to enter the desired replacement text. The selected text and the replacement text you provide will be sent to the AI service, which will generate a response based on the given context. The generated content will then replace the originally selected text in the open file.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

This command can be useful in various scenarios where you need to rephrase or rewrite a portion of text while maintaining context and coherence. Some potential use cases include:

1. **Improving clarity**: If a particular section of your code or documentation is unclear or convoluted, you can use this command to generate a more concise and understandable version.

2. **Suggesting alternative phrasing**: The AI service may provide alternative ways to express the same idea or concept, allowing you to explore different writing styles or perspectives.

3. **Generating summaries**: You can select a larger block of text and use this command to generate a concise summary, which can be helpful when creating documentation or notes.

4. **Incorporating AI-assisted writing**: By integrating this command into your workflow, you can leverage the capabilities of AI language models to assist with writing tasks, potentially improving productivity and quality.

## What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?

While the provided code does not explicitly reference any configuration options from the `dev-docs.json` file, it does utilize values stored in the `storageManager` object. These values likely come from user preferences or settings managed by the extension. Relevant configuration options could include:

1. **AI Service Endpoint**: The URL or endpoint of the AI service being used to generate the content replacements.
2. **API Keys or Authentication Tokens**: Credentials or tokens required to authenticate with the AI service.
3. **Default Organization**: If the AI service supports organization-level configurations or settings, this option could specify the default organization to use.
4. **AI Model Selection**: Some AI services offer different language models or configurations; this option could allow users to choose the desired model for text generation.
5. **Input Prompt Formatting**: Preferences for how the input prompt (the selected text and replacement text) should be formatted or structured before sending it to the AI service.

## Example JSON of relevant `dev-docs.json` options

```json
{
  "aiServiceEndpoint": "https://api.example.com/ai",
  "apiKey": "your_api_key_here",
  "defaultOrganization": "my_organization",
  "aiModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "inputPromptFormat": "{{selectedText}}\n\nReplace with: {{replacementText}}"
}
```

## Prerequisites

To use this VS Code Extension Command effectively, you should have:

1. **Visual Studio Code**: The command is designed to work within the Visual Studio Code editor environment.
2. **Extension Installed**: The extension that provides this command must be installed and enabled in your Visual Studio Code instance.
3. **AI Service Integration**: The extension should be configured to integrate with a compatible AI service for generating text replacements.
4. **Authentication and Configuration**: Ensure that you have set up the required authentication credentials and configuration options for the AI service within the extension's settings or `dev-docs.json` file.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use this VS Code Extension Command, follow these steps:

1. Open a file in Visual Studio Code that contains text you want to modify or rephrase.
2. Select the specific text you want to replace with AI-generated content by highlighting it with your cursor.
3. Trigger the command by navigating to the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and searching for "Replace Selected Text with AI-Generated Content" or the command ID `devdocs.replaceText`.
4. A prompt will appear asking you to enter the desired replacement text. Type in the text you want the AI service to use as context for generating the replacement content.
5. After entering the replacement text, press Enter or click the "OK" button.
6. The extension will send the selected text and the replacement text to the configured AI service, which will generate a response based on the provided context.
7. The originally selected text in the open file will be replaced with the AI-generated content.

Remember, the effectiveness of the generated content will depend on the capabilities of the AI service being used and the quality of the provided context (the selected text and replacement text). It's recommended to review the generated content and make any necessary adjustments or modifications to ensure it meets your requirements.
