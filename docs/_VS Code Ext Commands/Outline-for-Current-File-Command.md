# Outline for Current File

## What does this VS Code Extension Command do?

This command, `devdocs.outlineForCurrentFile`, generates an outline of the symbols (variables, functions, classes, etc.) present in the currently open file in the VS Code editor. It provides a structured representation of the code elements, allowing you to navigate and understand the code structure more easily.

## Why should I use this VS Code Extension Command?

Using this command can be beneficial for several reasons:

1. **Code Navigation**: The outline provides a clear and organized view of the code structure, making it easier to navigate through different sections of the file.
2. **Code Understanding**: By presenting the symbols and their relationships (e.g., parent-child relationships), the outline helps you comprehend the code's organization and dependencies.
3. **Quick Reference**: The outline serves as a quick reference for the available symbols in the file, saving you the time and effort of manually scanning through the code.
4. **Documentation Generation**: The generated outline can be used as a starting point for creating documentation or generating reference materials for the codebase.

## What are relevant configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?

The `dev-docs.json` file contains configuration options that can influence the behavior of the `devdocs.outlineForCurrentFile` command. The relevant options are:

1. `ai.internalTypeFilters`: This option allows you to specify the types of symbols to include in the outline. For example, you can choose to display only functions, variables, or classes.
2. `ai.codeFilters`: This option enables you to filter the symbols based on specific code patterns or snippets. It can be useful for narrowing down the outline to relevant sections of the code.
3. `ai.nameFilters`: This option lets you filter the symbols based on their names. You can specify a list of name patterns or substrings to include or exclude from the outline.

## Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "internalTypeFilters": ["function", "variable"],
    "codeFilters": ["export", "async"],
    "nameFilters": ["Symbol", "getSymbol"]
  }
}
```

In this example, the outline will include only functions and variables (`internalTypeFilters`), but only those that contain the `export` or `async` keywords (`codeFilters`) and have names containing the strings "Symbol" or "getSymbol" (`nameFilters`).

## Prerequisites

To use the `devdocs.outlineForCurrentFile` command, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. **VS Code**: The command is part of a VS Code extension, so you need to have Visual Studio Code installed on your machine.
2. **Extension Installed**: The extension that provides this command should be installed and enabled in your VS Code instance.

## How do I use this VS Code Extension Command?

To use the `devdocs.outlineForCurrentFile` command, follow these steps:

1. Open a file in the VS Code editor for which you want to generate the outline.
2. Use the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for the command `devdocs.outlineForCurrentFile`.
3. Select the command from the list.
4. The outline will be generated and displayed in the VS Code output panel or a dedicated view, depending on the extension's implementation.

You can further interact with the outline by expanding or collapsing sections, navigating to specific symbols in the code, or using the outline as a reference while working on the file.
