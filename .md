## Step 1: Install and Set Up the Extension

Ensure you have the Dev-Docs VS Code extension installed and properly configured.

## Step 2: Locate the Command

1. Open the Command Palette in VS Code (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).
2. Type "Dev-Docs: Generate External Docs" to find the command.

## Step 3: Run the Command

Execute the command by selecting it from the Command Palette.

## Step 4: Customize Generation with dev-docs.json

To customize the generation process, you need to modify the `dev-docs.json` file in your project root.

1. Open `dev-docs.json` in your project.
2. Look for the `ai` section, which controls the AI-based documentation generation.

Example structure:

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "externalDocPrompt": "Custom prompt for external documentation",
    "docPath": "docs",
    "branch": "main",
    "merge": true,
    "components": {
      "template": "path/to/component/template.md"
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Customization Options

1. `externalDocPrompt`: Customize the AI prompt for generating external docs.
2. `docPath`: Specify the directory where external docs will be saved.
3. `branch`: Set the Git branch for committing generated docs.
4. `merge`: Enable/disable merging of documentation for multiple symbols in a file.
5. `components`: Define custom MDX components for documentation.

## Step 5: Generate Documentation

After customizing `dev-docs.json`, run the "Populate External Docs" command again. The extension will use your settings to generate and save the documentation to a branch of your documentation repo tied to Dev-Docs.
