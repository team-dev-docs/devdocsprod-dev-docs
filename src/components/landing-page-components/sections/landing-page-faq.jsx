We believe that our users' security and privacy is paramount to our success. Your source code is your IP and should only be accessed by you.

    description: "Dev-Docs is for anyone who wants to generate content from their codebase or more efficiently generate documentation. We often find developers, technical writers, and product managers use us the most. Our goal is not to replace anyone but instead to give these folks super powers. That is, we want to automate the annoying elements of their jobs so they can focus on the more strategic and fun parts!",
