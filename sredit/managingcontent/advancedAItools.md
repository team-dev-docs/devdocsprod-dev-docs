# Advanced AI tooling

At Docs.dev we believe great writers are really great editors. That is, the true magic happens after a writer is able to get out the first draft. We've built tooling to help you generate new drafts directly from your existing docs and public codebases, as well as some other nifty tools to help you manage your docs as a whole. You can access these advanced features by selecting **AI Tools** in the top right of the editor and selecting the functionality you'd like from the dropdown.

Refer to the guides below to learn how to generate docs for your SDKs, generate all your docs from scratch, generate one off docs, and audit or analyze all your existing docs.

## Code objects

This feature allows you to generate net new docs from code objects directly in your SDK. To do this select the **AI tools** drop down in the top right of the web editor and select **Code objects**. Once selected, go through the drop down menus to select which code files the code object's are defined in and then which files have relevant context (if any) for those code objects. Then enter in a prompt to

If you do not see the relevant code files you can go into our GitHub app settings within GitHub to connect additional repos.
