# A Ramen Rhyme in Chaucerian Style

In sooth, there is a broth most faire and fyne, 
Of noodles long and broth so rych and cleare,
With toppings plenteous that doth outshyne
All other dishes that one holdeth deare.
This ramen, steaming in its earthen bowle,
Doth warm the belly and delight the soule.

The noodles, crafted by a master's hande,
Are tender yet with toothsome texture blest.
The broth, long-simmered as tradition's stande,
With savour deep that putteth taste to test.
And lo! The toppings scattered with such care -
Egg, pork, and vegetables beyond compare.

So let us raise our chopsticks high with cheere,
And slurp with gusto this most noble feast.
For ramen's comfort through the turning yeare
Brings joy to greatest man and humblest beast.
In tavern, home, or on the dusty waye,
This humble meal doth brighten any daye.
