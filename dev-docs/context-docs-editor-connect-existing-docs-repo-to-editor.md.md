## Imported Code Object
The phrase "Connect your existing docs to the AI editor" in this context refers to a process of linking your existing documentation repository on GitHub to an AI-powered documentation editor tool, likely provided by a service called Dev-Docs.

This process involves several steps:

1. Initiating the connection process in the Dev-Docs interface
2. Installing a GitHub App that allows Dev-Docs to access your repository
3. Selecting the specific GitHub repository that contains your documentation
4. Associating the selected repository with your Dev-Docs organization
5. Configuring Dev-Docs to recognize the selected repository as your documentation source

Once completed, this connection allows you to use the AI-powered editor to create, edit, and manage your documentation directly, with changes being pushed back to your GitHub repository. This setup creates a seamless workflow between your existing documentation storage (GitHub) and the AI-enhanced editing capabilities provided by Dev-Docs.
