## Imported Code Object
The `MDXContentWrapper` is a React component that serves as a wrapper for MDX (Markdown with JSX) content. Its main purposes are:

1. Conditional rendering: It checks if the content is from a blog or changelog, and renders different layouts accordingly.

2. Metadata handling: It processes and displays metadata from the MDX content, such as title, authors, date, and reading time.

3. Styling: It applies custom styles and background images based on the frontmatter of the MDX content.

4. Navigation: It includes a click handler for navigation to other pages.

5. Content wrapping: It wraps the actual MDX content (passed as `props.children`) in either a `BackgroundGradientAnimation` component for blog/changelog posts or a `TracingBeam` component for other content types.

This wrapper enhances the presentation of MDX content by adding visual elements, metadata display, and conditional formatting based on the content type and frontmatter data.
