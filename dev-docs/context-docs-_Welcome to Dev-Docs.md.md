## context
This file appears to be a welcome page or introduction for Dev-Docs, a documentation tool for developers. The content provides an overview of the tool's purpose and its two main use cases:

1. External Documentation: Aimed at users, customers, developers, and partners who interact with the organization's APIs, SDKs, or applications. It focuses on improving developer experience and providing self-service implementation and support guides.

2. Internal Documentation: Intended for internal software engineering teams and contributors to the codebase. It helps with knowledge sharing, maintaining consistency, collaboration, and onboarding new team members. It also serves as a record of decision-making processes and explanations of how the codebase works.

The file is likely formatted in Markdown, as indicated by the '#' symbols for headings, and is probably part of a larger documentation structure within the Dev-Docs system.
