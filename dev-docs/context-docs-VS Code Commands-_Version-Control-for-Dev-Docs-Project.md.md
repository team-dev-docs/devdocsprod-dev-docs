# Example JSON of Relevant `dev-docs.json` Options docs/VS Code Commands/_Version-Control-for-Dev-Docs-Project.md
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the "Example JSON of Relevant `dev-docs.json` Options" shown in the code snippet:

This JSON object represents configuration options for a development documentation tool or system. It contains three key-value pairs:

1. `"ai"`: Specifies the branch to use for AI-related functionality, in this case, "main".
2. `"customRoot"`: Defines a custom root directory for a specific package within the project, here set to "packages/my-package".
3. `"workspaceRoot"`: Sets the absolute path to the project's root directory, in this example, "/path/to/project".

These options likely control various aspects of how the documentation tool processes and generates documentation for the project, including where to look for source files and how to handle AI-related features.
