This Markdown file is a guide for installing the Dev-Docs VS Code extension. It appears to be part of a documentation website, likely built with a static site generator that uses frontmatter (such as Docusaurus, given the 'sidebar_position' metadata). The document provides a step-by-step tutorial with visual aids (screenshots) to help users install the extension in Visual Studio Code. It's structured in a clear, user-friendly manner, making it easy for developers to follow along and set up the Dev-Docs extension in their VS Code environment.
