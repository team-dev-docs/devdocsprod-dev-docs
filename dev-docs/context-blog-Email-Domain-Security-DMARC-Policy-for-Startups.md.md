## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the DMARC record in the given code snippet:

This is a DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) record. It specifies how email receivers should handle messages that fail authentication checks. The record contains three parts:

1. `v=DMARC1`: Version of DMARC being used (currently version 1).

2. `p=none`: Policy for handling failed messages. "none" means no action is taken, but reports are still generated.

3. `rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@{{our domain}}`: Specifies the email address where aggregate reports should be sent.

This DMARC record is set up for monitoring purposes, collecting data on email authentication without enforcing any actions on failed messages.
