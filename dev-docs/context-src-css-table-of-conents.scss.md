# High Level Context
## context
This SCSS file is responsible for styling the Table of Contents (TOC) component in a documentation website, likely built with Docusaurus. It customizes the appearance of the TOC for both desktop and mobile views. Key features include:

1. Removing the default background for collapsible buttons
2. Adding a custom "On this Page" heading with an SVG icon
3. Styling the TOC links, including hover and active states
4. Adding a vertical line indicator for the active TOC item
5. Customizing fonts, colors, and other visual properties to match the site's design

The file also includes some commented-out code for potential backdrop filter effects, which could be used to create a glassmorphism effect for the TOC in both light and dark themes.

# .theme-doc-toc-desktop::before src/css/table-of-conents.scss
## Imported Code Object
In the provided code snippet, `.theme-doc-toc-desktop::before` is a CSS pseudo-element selector that targets the `::before` pseudo-element of elements with the class `theme-doc-toc-desktop`.

The `::before` pseudo-element creates a virtual element as the first child of the selected element, allowing you to insert content before the element's actual content.

In this case, it's being used to:

1. Add the text "On this Page" (which is then overridden).
2. Insert an SVG icon using a data URI.
3. Add the text "On this Page" again after the icon.
4. Apply specific font styles to this inserted content.

This technique is often used to add decorative elements or labels to elements without modifying the HTML structure.

# .table-of-contents__link--active::before src/css/table-of-conents.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `.table-of-contents__link--active::before`:

This CSS selector targets the `::before` pseudo-element of an element with the class `table-of-contents__link--active`. It's typically used to add content or styling before the actual content of the selected element. In this case:

1. `content: ("");` adds an empty string before the element's content.
2. `margin-right: 0.5rem;` adds a right margin of 0.5rem to this pseudo-element.
3. `border-right: 0.5px solid var(--ifm-color-primary);` creates a 0.5px solid border on the right side of the pseudo-element, using a color defined by the CSS variable `--ifm-color-primary`.

This is often used to create a visual indicator (like a vertical line) next to the active item in a table of contents, without modifying the actual HTML structure.

# .table-of-contents__link src/css/table-of-conents.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation:

`.table-of-contents__link` is a CSS class selector that targets elements with the class `table-of-contents__link`. This class is likely used for styling links within a table of contents. The CSS rules define the following properties for these elements:

1. Text color: Light gray (#a2a1a5)
2. Font: Inter
3. Font size: 14 pixels
4. Font style: Normal (not italic)
5. Font weight: Medium (500)
6. Line height: Normal

These styles are applied to create a consistent appearance for table of contents links in the document or application.
