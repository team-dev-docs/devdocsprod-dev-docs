# SearchBarWrapper src/theme/SearchBar.js
## Imported Code Object
The `SearchBarWrapper` is a React functional component that wraps around a `SearchBar` component, adding additional functionality and styling. Here's a concise explanation of its key features:

1. It logs the received props to the console.

2. It uses the `useColorMode` hook to manage color mode (light/dark).

3. It sets up event listeners for:
   - Command+K keypress
   - Click on the search bar

4. These events toggle between light and dark modes, updating the DOM and component state accordingly.

5. It modifies the props passed to the `SearchBar` component, allowing for customization (e.g., changing the placeholder text).

6. It renders the `SearchBar` component within a styled container, passing along the modified props.

In essence, this wrapper enhances the basic `SearchBar` component with color mode toggling functionality and custom styling, while allowing for easy prop manipulation.
