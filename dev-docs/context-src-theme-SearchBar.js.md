# SearchBarWrapper src/theme/SearchBar.js
## Imported Code Object
The `SearchBarWrapper` is a React functional component that serves as a wrapper around a `SearchBar` component. Its main purposes are:

1. Event Handling: It sets up event listeners for the 'Command + K' keyboard shortcut and for clicks on the search bar.

2. Color Mode Toggle: It manages the color mode (light/dark) of the application, toggling it when the search bar is clicked or the keyboard shortcut is used.

3. Prop Modification: It allows for modification of props passed to the `SearchBar` component.

4. Layout: It provides a specific layout structure for the search bar, wrapping it in centered divs.

5. Lifecycle Management: It uses `useEffect` to handle adding and removing event listeners based on the component's lifecycle.

This wrapper enhances the functionality of the basic `SearchBar` component by adding these additional features and behaviors.
