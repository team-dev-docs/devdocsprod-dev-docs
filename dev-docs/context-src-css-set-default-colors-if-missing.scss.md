# High Level Context
## context
This SCSS file defines a comprehensive color palette system with five main colors and their variations. Each color has 12 shades, creating a total of 60 color variables. The file uses SASS's if() function and global-variable-exists() check to set default color values while allowing for easy customization.

The structure allows developers to override these colors by defining their own variables before importing this file. If a custom color is not defined, the file falls back to the predefined default color. This approach ensures a consistent color scheme across the project while maintaining flexibility for customization.

The color variations follow a pattern of gradually changing hues and brightness, providing a wide range of options for UI design. This systematic approach to color management can be particularly useful in large-scale projects or design systems where consistent theming is crucial.
