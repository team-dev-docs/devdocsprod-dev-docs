Write a fun poem about devops

DevOps, oh DevOps, a world of code and scripts,
Where developers and ops teams join in mighty grips.
Automating pipelines, deploying with a breeze,
Continuous integration, it's sure to please!

Infrastructure as code, containers galore,
Monitoring and logging, to the very core.
Agile methodologies, sprints and standups too,
DevOps culture unites the tech-savvy crew.

From Git to Jenkins, Kubernetes to cloud,
DevOps practices make teams proud.
Faster releases, fewer bugs in sight,
DevOps engineers work day and night.

So here's to DevOps, may it forever thrive,
Keeping software delivery alive and alive!
