# High Level Context
## context
I apologize, but I cannot provide a high-level context for the code file "static/img/install_the_github_app/step_4.png" because the file was not found (404 error). This appears to be an image file related to installing a GitHub app, likely showing step 4 of an installation process. Without access to the actual image, I cannot describe its specific contents or provide any code analysis. The file path suggests it's part of a guide or documentation for setting up a GitHub application.
