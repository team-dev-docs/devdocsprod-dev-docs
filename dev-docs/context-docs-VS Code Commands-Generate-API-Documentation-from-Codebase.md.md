# High Level Context
## context
This file describes a VS Code extension command called `devdocs.generateAPIDocumentation` that automatically generates API documentation from a codebase. The command analyzes the code to identify API routes and creates two main outputs:

1. A Postman Collection JSON file containing all detected API routes.
2. An OpenAPI (Swagger) specification file for the API.

The document explains the benefits of using this command, including keeping documentation synchronized with code, saving time, improving developer experience, and facilitating testing and collaboration.

It also outlines the relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file, prerequisites for using the command, and step-by-step instructions on how to use it within VS Code.

Overall, this file serves as a comprehensive guide for developers to understand and utilize the automatic API documentation generation feature provided by this VS Code extension, enhancing their workflow and project organization.

# Generating API Documentation and Config
"Generating API Documentation and Config" refers to an automated process that:

1. Analyzes the codebase to identify API routes.
2. Creates a Postman Collection JSON file containing all detected API routes.
3. Generates an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification file for the API.

This process is triggered by the `devdocs.generateAPIDocumentation` command, which automates the creation of API documentation and configuration files directly from the source code. This automation helps maintain up-to-date and accurate API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand, interact with, and test the API.

# Why Should I Use This VS Code Extension Command?
The "Why Should I Use This VS Code Extension Command?" section outlines four key advantages of using the extension to automatically generate API documentation from your codebase:

1. It keeps documentation in sync with code changes, ensuring accuracy.
2. It saves time and effort compared to manual documentation, increasing productivity.
3. It improves the developer experience by providing clear and consistent API information.
4. It facilitates testing and collaboration through generated Postman Collections and OpenAPI specifications.

These benefits highlight the practical advantages of using the extension for maintaining up-to-date and accurate API documentation, which can lead to improved efficiency, reduced errors, and better collaboration in software development projects.

# What are relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json`?
The `dev-docs.json` file contains important configuration options for the `devdocs.generateAPIDocumentation` command. Key options include:

- `ai.openapi.file`: Defines the file path where the generated OpenAPI specification file should be saved.
- `ai.postman.collection`: Specifies the file path for the generated Postman Collection JSON file.
- `ai.excludePaths`: An array of paths to exclude from API route detection.

These configurations allow users to customize the output locations and scope of the API documentation generation process, providing flexibility and control over the resulting files.

---
# Example JSON of relevant Dev-Docs.json options
```json
{
  "ai": {
    "openapi": {
      "file": "src/api/openapi.yaml"
    },
    "postman": {
      "collection": "src/api/postman_collection.json"
    },
    "excludePaths": [
      "src/tests",
      "src/mocks"
    ]
  }
}
```

This example configuration specifies the output paths for the OpenAPI specification and Postman Collection, as well as directories to exclude from the API route detection process.

# Prerequisites
Before using the `devdocs.generateAPIDocumentation` command, ensure that:

1. The project has a `dev-docs.json` file located in the root directory.
2. The `dev-docs.json` file is correctly set up with the appropriate configuration options.
3. The VS Code extension is properly installed and activated in your workspace.
4. You have the necessary permissions to write files in the specified output locations.

Meeting these prerequisites ensures that the API documentation generation process runs smoothly and produces the expected results.

---
# How Do I Use This VS Code Extension Command?
To use the `devdocs.generateAPIDocumentation` command:

1. Open your project in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the command palette.
3. Type "devdocs.generateAPIDocumentation" and select the command when it appears.
4. The extension will analyze your codebase and generate the API documentation.
5. Once complete, you'll find the generated Postman Collection and OpenAPI specification files in the locations specified in your `dev-docs.json`.

Using this command regularly, especially after making changes to your API, ensures that your documentation remains current and accurate, improving overall project maintainability and team collaboration.
