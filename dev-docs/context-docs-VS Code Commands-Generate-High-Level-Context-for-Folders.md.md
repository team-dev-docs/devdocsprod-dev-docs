# High Level Context
## Context
This markdown file describes a VS Code extension command called "Generate High Level Context for the Folder". The command analyzes all code files within a selected folder and generates a comprehensive summary of the folder's purpose and functionality. Key points include:

1. The command's purpose is to provide a high-level overview of a folder's contents without examining individual files.
2. It's particularly useful for large codebases, onboarding new team members, conducting code reviews, and documenting project architecture.
3. The file details relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file, including `ai.contextDirs`, `ai.internalTypeFilters`, `customRoot`, and `workspaceRoot`.
4. It provides an example JSON configuration for the relevant options.
5. The file outlines prerequisites for using the command, including a valid `dev-docs.json` file and proper folder location.
6. Instructions for using the command are provided, both through the Explorer view context menu and the Command Palette.
7. The generated high-level context document aims to improve understanding of code structure and organization within the selected folder.
8. The command leverages AI technology to analyze and summarize code, providing insights that might be time-consuming to gather manually.
9. Users can customize the depth and breadth of the analysis by adjusting the configuration options in `dev-docs.json`.

# Example JSON of Relevant `dev-docs.json` Options docs/VS Code Commands/Generate-High-Level-Context-for-Folders.md
## Imported Code Object
This JSON snippet represents configuration options for a development documentation tool. Here's a concise explanation of its key components:

1. "ai" object:
   - "contextDirs": Specifies directories to include for AI context generation.
   - "internalTypeFilters": Lists types of code elements to consider in the analysis.

2. "customRoot": Defines a custom root directory for the package, allowing for flexible project structures.

3. "workspaceRoot": Specifies the absolute path to the project's root directory, ensuring consistent file references.

These options control how the documentation tool processes and generates documentation for a project, including which directories to analyze, what types of code elements to document, and where to locate project files. By fine-tuning these settings, developers can tailor the high-level context generation to their specific project needs and organizational preferences.
