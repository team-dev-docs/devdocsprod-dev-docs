# High Level Context
## context
This markdown file describes a VS Code extension command called "Generate High Level Context for the Folder". The command analyzes all code files within a selected folder and generates a comprehensive summary of the folder's purpose and functionality. Key points include:

1. The command's purpose is to provide a high-level overview of a folder's contents without examining individual files.
2. It's useful for large codebases, onboarding new team members, code reviews, and documenting project architecture.
3. The file details relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file, including `ai.contextDirs`, `ai.internalTypeFilters`, `customRoot`, and `workspaceRoot`.
4. It provides an example JSON configuration for the relevant options.
5. The file outlines prerequisites for using the command, including a valid `dev-docs.json` file and proper folder location.
6. Instructions for using the command are provided, both through the Explorer view context menu and the Command Palette.
7. The generated high-level context document aims to improve understanding of code structure and organization within the selected folder.

# Example JSON of Relevant `dev-docs.json` Options docs/VS Code Commands/Generate-High-Level-Context-for-Folders.md
## Imported Code Object
This JSON snippet represents configuration options for a development documentation tool. Here's a concise explanation of its key components:

1. "ai" object:
   - "contextDirs": Specifies directories to include for AI context.
   - "internalTypeFilters": Lists types of code elements to consider.

2. "customRoot": Defines a custom root directory for the package.

3. "workspaceRoot": Specifies the absolute path to the project's root directory.

These options likely control how the documentation tool processes and generates documentation for a project, including which directories to analyze, what types of code elements to document, and where to locate project files.
