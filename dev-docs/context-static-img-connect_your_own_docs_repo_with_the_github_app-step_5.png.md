## context
This is not actually a code file, but an HTML document that represents the structure of a web page. It appears to be the main HTML file for a web application called "devdocs-webapp". Key points about this file:

1. It's set up for a dark theme.
2. It includes necessary meta tags for responsiveness and compatibility.
3. It loads external JavaScript libraries, including html2canvas.
4. It includes links to CSS and JavaScript files, likely containing the main application code and styles.
5. The body contains a noscript warning for users with JavaScript disabled.
6. The main application is rendered within a div with id "app", suggesting this is likely a single-page application built with a framework like Vue.js or React.

This HTML file serves as the entry point for the devdocs-webapp, setting up the basic structure and loading necessary resources for the application to run.
