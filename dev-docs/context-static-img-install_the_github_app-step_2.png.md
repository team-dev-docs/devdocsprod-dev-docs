## context
The file "static/img/install_the_github_app/step_2.png" appears to be an image file, not a code file. Based on its location and name, it is likely a screenshot or visual guide illustrating the second step in a process for installing a GitHub app. Without being able to view the actual image, I cannot provide specific details about its contents. However, such images are commonly used in documentation or tutorials to provide visual instructions for users following a step-by-step process.
