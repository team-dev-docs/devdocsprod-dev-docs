# devdocs.generateBatchDocumentation
## Overview
The `devdocs.generateBatchDocumentation` command is a powerful feature that automates the process of generating documentation for multiple functions within a codefile. Operating in batch mode, it can create documentation for all or many functions in the file simultaneously, rather than documenting each function individually. This tool is designed to streamline the documentation process, significantly reducing the time and effort required for developers to document their code efficiently.

## Key Features
- Batch processing of multiple functions
- AI-assisted analysis of code structure
- Customizable output based on predefined prompts
- Integration with existing VS Code workflows

## Configuration
Users can fine-tune the behavior and output of the batch documentation process using various options in the `dev-docs.json` configuration file. These options include:

- Custom prompts for different code elements
- Filters to include or exclude specific functions
- Output file paths for generated documentation
- Formatting preferences for the resulting documentation

By leveraging these configuration options, developers can ensure that the generated documentation aligns with their project's specific needs and coding standards.
