# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2024-10-18

### Added
- New image file: `static/img/connect_your_own_docs_repo_with_the_github_app/step_4.png`
  - This appears to be a screenshot or image related to step 4 of connecting your own docs repo with the GitHub app.
  - The file content suggests it's an HTML page, possibly a placeholder or an error page.

### Notes
- The commit was made by user "avb-is-me".
- The image file seems to contain HTML content instead of an actual image, which might be unintentional or a placeholder.
- Developers should verify if this is the intended content for the image file or if there's an issue with the file upload.

This changelog represents a single commit, so the changes are limited. For a more comprehensive changelog, multiple commits over time would provide a better overview of the project's evolution.
