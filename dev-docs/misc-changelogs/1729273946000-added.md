# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2024-10-18

### Added
- New image file: `static/img/yeahyeahnetwork/step_2.png`
  - This appears to be an HTML file content added as an image, which might be unintended. The content suggests it's a basic HTML structure for a web application named "devdocs-webapp" with dark theme support.

### Notes
- The commit adds a single file, but the content appears to be HTML rather than an actual image. This might be an error or unintended commit.
- Developers should review this addition to ensure it's the correct content for the intended image file.

This changelog reflects the changes made in the single commit provided. It's worth noting that the content added as an image file seems unusual and might require further investigation or correction.
