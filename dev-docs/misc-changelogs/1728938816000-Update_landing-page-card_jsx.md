## [Unreleased] - 2024-10-14

### Changed
- Modified `src/components/landing-page-components/parts/landing-page-card.jsx`:
  - Updated a comment: Changed "test test" to "test tes"

This change appears to be minor, possibly a typo correction or a small adjustment to a comment in the landing page card component. The modification doesn't seem to affect the functionality of the code, but it updates the documentation or internal notes within the component.
