## 2024-10-18

### Added
- New image: `static/img/yeahyeahnetwork/step_1.png`
  - This appears to be an HTML file containing the structure for a web application called "devdocs-webapp".
  - The file includes references to external JavaScript and CSS resources.
  - It sets up a dark theme and includes a reference to the html2canvas library.

### Developer Notes
- The addition of this file suggests the beginning or expansion of documentation or a tutorial related to a "YeahYeah Network" feature.
- The HTML structure indicates a Single Page Application (SPA) setup, likely using a framework like Vue.js (based on the `<div id="app"></div>
` structure).
- Developers should be aware that this change introduces new assets and potentially new functionality related to the YeahYeah Network feature.
