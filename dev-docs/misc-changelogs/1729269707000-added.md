## [Unreleased] - 2024-10-18

### Added
- New image: `static/img/connect_your_own_docs_repo_with_the_github_app/step_1.png`
  - This appears to be a screenshot or image related to connecting a custom docs repository using a GitHub app.

### Notes
- The added file seems to contain HTML content, which is unusual for an image file. This might be an error or a placeholder file that needs to be replaced with an actual image.
- The commit doesn't provide much context about the purpose of this addition or any related changes to documentation or functionality.

Developers should be aware that this change introduces a new asset, potentially for documentation purposes, but should verify the content and intended use of this file.
