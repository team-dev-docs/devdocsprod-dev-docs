# High Level Context
## context
This SCSS file (src/css/root-and-body.scss) is responsible for defining the overall styling and theming of a web application, likely built with Docusaurus. It includes:

1. Color variable definitions for both light and dark themes
2. CSS custom properties for theming
3. Styling for both light and dark modes
4. Background gradients and images for different page elements
5. Responsive design adjustments
6. Styling for specific Docusaurus-related elements
7. Backdrop filters and blur effects
8. Positioning and layout for various page components

The file uses a mix of global styles, theme-specific styles, and targets Docusaurus-specific class names to create a cohesive visual design across the application, with separate configurations for light and dark modes.

# .spark-circle src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `.spark-circle` in the provided code snippet:

`.spark-circle` is a CSS class selector that defines styles for an element. It sets a white background for the element it's applied to. 

Inside `.spark-circle`, there's a nested selector `.rounded-full`. This applies additional styles to any child element with the class `rounded-full` within an element that has the `spark-circle` class. These nested styles set the background, background-color, and border-color to a variable `$color-1`, using the `!important` declaration to give these rules higher priority.

This structure suggests the use of a CSS preprocessor like Sass or LESS, which allows for nested selectors and variable usage (`$color-1`).

# [data-theme="dark"] #__docusaurus::before src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `[data-theme="dark"] #__docusaurus::before`:

This CSS selector targets a pseudo-element (::before) of an element with the ID `__docusaurus`, but only when the parent or ancestor element has a data attribute `data-theme` set to "dark". It's commonly used in Docusaurus (a documentation website generator) to apply styles specifically to the dark theme mode of the website.

In simpler terms:
- It applies to the dark theme only
- It targets a special element created before the main content of the Docusaurus container
- It's used to add decorative or functional elements without modifying the HTML structure

# [data-theme="dark"] [class^="docPage"]::before src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the selector `[data-theme="dark"] [class^="docPage"]::before`:

1. `[data-theme="dark"]`: Targets elements with a `data-theme` attribute set to "dark".
2. `[class^="docPage"]`: Selects elements whose class name starts with "docPage".
3. `::before`: Targets the pseudo-element before the selected element.

Combined, this selector applies styles to the `::before` pseudo-element of any element with a class starting with "docPage" that is a descendant of an element with `data-theme="dark"`. This is commonly used for creating a background effect or overlay on dark-themed documentation pages.

# [data-theme="dark"] [class^="docRoot"]::before src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `[data-theme="dark"] [class^="docRoot"]::before`:

1. `[data-theme="dark"]`: This targets elements with a `data-theme` attribute set to "dark".

2. `[class^="docRoot"]`: This selects elements whose class name starts with "docRoot".

3. `::before`: This is a pseudo-element that creates a virtual element before the content of the selected element.

So, `[data-theme="dark"] [class^="docRoot"]::before` applies styles to a pseudo-element created before any element with a class starting with "docRoot" that is inside an element with `data-theme="dark"`. This is typically used for theming, where different styles are applied based on the current theme (in this case, the dark theme).

# [class^="docPage"] src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation:

`[class^="docPage"]` is an attribute selector in CSS. It targets any element whose class attribute begins with the string "docPage". This means it will select elements with classes like "docPage", "docPage-header", "docPageContent", etc.

The `^=` part is what specifies that the class should start with the given string. This selector is useful for targeting multiple related elements without needing to list every specific class name.

# [data-theme="light"] [class^="docPage"]::before src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the selector `[data-theme="light"] [class^="docPage"]::before`:

1. `[data-theme="light"]`: Targets elements with a `data-theme` attribute set to "light".
2. `[class^="docPage"]`: Selects elements whose class name starts with "docPage".
3. `::before`: Refers to a pseudo-element, creating a virtual element before the content of the selected element.

Combined, this selector applies styles to a pseudo-element created before any element with a class starting with "docPage", but only when it's within an element that has `data-theme="light"`. This is likely used for theming or styling specific documentation pages in a light theme context.

---
# [data-theme="light"] [class^="docRoot"]::before src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `[data-theme="light"] [class^="docRoot"]::before`:

1. `[data-theme="light"]`: This targets elements with a `data-theme` attribute set to "light".

2. `[class^="docRoot"]`: This selects elements whose class name starts with "docRoot".

3. `::before`: This is a pseudo-element that creates a virtual element before the content of the selected element.

So, `[data-theme="light"] [class^="docRoot"]::before` targets a pseudo-element created before any element with a class starting with "docRoot" that is a descendant of an element with `data-theme="light"`. This selector is used to apply styles to this pseudo-element, creating a decorative background effect for light-themed pages.

# #__docusaurus src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation:

The `#__docusaurus` selector in this CSS code snippet refers to an HTML element with the ID of "__docusaurus". This is likely a specific element used by the Docusaurus documentation framework. The CSS rules define the following properties for this element:

1. `position: relative;` - Positions the element relative to its normal position.
2. `overflow: visible;` - Allows content to overflow the element's boundaries.
3. `border: none;` - Removes any border from the element.

These styles are probably part of the Docusaurus framework's default styling or a custom theme, used to control the layout and appearance of a specific container or wrapper element within the documentation site.

# [data-theme="light"] #__docusaurus::before src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
This CSS selector and its associated styles can be explained as follows:

1. `[data-theme="light"]`: This targets elements with a `data-theme` attribute set to "light".

2. `#__docusaurus`: This targets an element with the ID `__docusaurus`.

3. `::before`: This is a pseudo-element that creates a virtual element before the content of the selected element.

Combined, `[data-theme="light"] #__docusaurus::before` applies styles to a pseudo-element created before the content of an element with ID `__docusaurus`, but only when the light theme is active.

The styles create a decorative background image positioned at the top right of the page, with specific dimensions, opacity, and z-index to place it behind other content. This is likely used to add a visual element to the page's background in the light theme mode.

---
# [class^="docRoot"] src/css/root-and-body.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `[class^="docRoot"]`:

`[class^="docRoot"]` is an attribute selector in CSS. It targets any element whose `class` attribute starts with the string "docRoot". The `^=` means "starts with". 

So, this selector will match elements with classes like:
- `class="docRoot"`
- `class="docRootHeader"`
- `class="docRoot-content"`

But it won't match:
- `class="mydocRoot"`
- `class="doc-Root"`

This selector is used to style elements that have a class name beginning with "docRoot", applying the specified styles (background color, padding at larger screen sizes, and image margins) to those elements and their descendant `img` elements.
