# High Level Context
## context
This JSON file is likely part of a documentation system or website structure, possibly using a framework like Docusaurus. It defines metadata for a category of documentation called "Initial Setup":

1. The "label" field sets the display name for this category.
2. The "position" field (value 3) probably determines the order in which this category appears relative to others.
3. The "link" object with "type": "generated-index" suggests that an index page will be automatically generated for this category, listing its contents.

This file helps organize and structure the documentation, making it easier for users to navigate and find information about the initial setup process for the documented project or system.
