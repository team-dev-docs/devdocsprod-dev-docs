## context
This file provides documentation for the "Populate External Docs" command in a VS Code extension. The command automatically generates external documentation for code symbols (classes, methods, functions) and stores it in a JSON file. Key points include:

1. Purpose: To save time and effort in creating and maintaining external documentation.
2. Configuration: Utilizes a dev-docs.json file to control various aspects of the documentation generation process.
3. Relevant options: internalTypeFilters, codeFilters, nameFilters, and populateDoc.
4. Prerequisites: User must be signed into Dev-Docs, have a default organization set, and have a dev-docs.json file in the project root.
5. Usage: The command is accessed through the VS Code Command Palette.
6. Output: Generated documentation is populated to the Dev-Docs Repo file in the project root.

The file also includes an example JSON configuration and explains the benefits of using this command for keeping documentation up-to-date with code changes.

Additionally, the "Populate External Docs" command offers the following advantages:

7. Consistency: Ensures documentation follows a standardized format across the project.
8. Time-saving: Automates the process of documenting code, reducing manual effort.
9. Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the development workflow within VS Code.
10. Customization: Allows fine-tuning of documentation generation through configuration options.

By leveraging this command, developers can maintain high-quality, current documentation without significant overhead, ultimately improving code maintainability and team collaboration.
