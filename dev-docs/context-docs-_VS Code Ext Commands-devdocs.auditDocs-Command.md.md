# High Level Context
## context
This file describes a Visual Studio Code extension command called "devdocs.auditDocs" that automates the process of auditing and improving documentation in a project. The command uses AI to analyze markdown files in a project's docs directory, suggesting improvements for grammar, spelling, clarity, and aesthetics. It generates an "_audit.md" file with suggestions and creates GitHub issues for each analyzed file.

Key features of the command include:
1. Analyzing all markdown files in the docs directory
2. Using AI to generate improvement suggestions
3. Creating a comprehensive audit report
4. Generating GitHub issues for each file
5. Customizable audit tasks via dev-docs.json configuration

The file also explains why this command is useful, how to use it, and what configuration options are available in the dev-docs.json file. It emphasizes the benefits of maintaining high-quality documentation and how this automated process can save time and effort for developers and technical writers.

## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation:

This JSON snippet represents a portion of a `dev-docs.json` configuration file. It defines options for AI-assisted tasks related to documentation auditing. Specifically:

1. The `ai` object contains settings for AI-related features.
2. The `auditTasks` array lists specific tasks for the AI to perform during documentation audits.
3. In this example, there are two audit tasks defined:
   - Checking compliance with project-specific style guides
   - Ensuring technical accuracy and correctness of code examples

This configuration would be used to guide AI-powered tools in performing automated checks on development documentation, focusing on these specific aspects of quality assurance.
