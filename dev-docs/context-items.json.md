## context
This JSON file appears to define a navigation menu structure for a website or application. It contains an array of "items" that represent different menu options. Each item has properties such as:

1. "position": Indicating where the item should be placed in the menu (e.g., "left")
2. "label": The text displayed for the menu item
3. "prependBaseUrlToHref": A boolean flag likely used to determine if a base URL should be added to the href
4. "href": The URL or path the menu item links to

The items listed include "Get Started" (linking to a documentation page), "Blog", and "Changelog". This structure is commonly used in content management systems, documentation websites, or web applications to configure navigation menus dynamically.
