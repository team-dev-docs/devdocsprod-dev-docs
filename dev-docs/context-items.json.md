# High Level Context
## context
This JSON file appears to be a configuration for a website's navigation menu or sidebar. It contains an array of "items" that represent different pages or sections of the website. Each item has properties such as:

1. "position": Indicating where the item should be placed (e.g., "left")
2. "label": The text to display for the navigation item
3. "prependBaseUrlToHref": A boolean flag, likely used to determine if the base URL should be added to the href
4. "href": The relative URL path for the item

The items in this file include links to "Docs", "Blog", and "Changelog" sections. This configuration is likely used by a website's framework or content management system to generate the navigation structure dynamically.
