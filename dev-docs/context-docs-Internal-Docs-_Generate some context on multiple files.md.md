# High Level Context
## context
This file appears to be a guide or tutorial on how to generate context from multiple files within a development environment, likely using a specific code editor or IDE with a "DEV-DOCS" feature. The process involves:

1. Opening the project in the code editor
2. Accessing the "DEV-DOCS" menu
3. Clicking on the "Generate Context" button
4. Waiting for the loading process to complete
5. Selecting specific files to use for context generation
6. Choosing where to create the context (either in the codebase or user-facing docs)
7. Generating a new document with the compiled context

This feature seems designed to help developers create comprehensive documentation or context for their projects by analyzing multiple files simultaneously. It's likely part of a larger documentation or project management tool integrated into the development environment.
