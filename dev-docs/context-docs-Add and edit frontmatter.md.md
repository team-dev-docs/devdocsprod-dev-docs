## context
This file provides a step-by-step guide for adding and editing frontmatter in a document. Frontmatter is metadata that appears at the beginning of a file and contains information about the document. The guide walks users through the process of:

1. Opening the metadata drawer
2. Adding new parameters (such as "title" and "author")
3. Inputting values for these parameters
4. Saving the changes

The instructions are accompanied by screenshots to illustrate each step, making it easy for users to follow along. This guide is likely part of a larger documentation set for a content management system or a markdown-based writing tool.
