# Modify YAML Documentation Command docs/VS Code Commands/_Modify-Yaml-API-Documentation-Command.md
## Imported Code Object
The `devdocs.modifyAPIYAMLDocumentation` is a powerful VS Code extension command that simplifies the process of updating API documentation in OpenAPI (Swagger) YAML files. It utilizes AI to modify specific sections like tags, summaries, code samples, and descriptions for given API routes.

Key features:
1. User-friendly interface for seamless API doc updates
2. AI-powered content generation for accuracy and consistency
3. Support for multiple programming languages in code samples
4. Flexible configuration through `dev-docs.json`
5. Integration with existing OpenAPI specifications

To use the command:
1. Ensure all prerequisites are met (OpenAPI YAML file, configured `dev-docs.json`)
2. Open the Command Palette in VS Code
3. Execute the "Modify Yaml" command
4. Select the desired API route and documentation section to update
5. Review and confirm the AI-generated changes
6. Optionally, make manual adjustments to fine-tune the documentation

This command significantly streamlines API documentation maintenance, saving developers time and ensuring that the documentation remains consistent with the latest API specification. It's particularly useful for teams working on rapidly evolving APIs or those looking to improve their documentation workflow.

# Example JSON of Relevant `dev-docs.json` Options docs/VS Code Commands/_Modify-Yaml-API-Documentation-Command.md
## Imported Code Object
This JSON snippet represents configuration options for a development documentation system, specifically tailored for AI-assisted API documentation generation:

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "openapi": {
      "file": "src/api/openapi.yaml",
      "x-codeSamples": {
        "langs": ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby", "Go"]
      }
    },
    "customPrompts": {
      "summaryStyle": "concise and technical",
      "descriptionDepth": "detailed"
    }
  }
}
```

Key components:
1. The "ai" object contains AI-related settings for documentation generation.
2. "openapi" specifies OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) configuration:
   - "file" points to the OpenAPI specification file location.
   - "x-codeSamples" is a custom extension for code sample generation:
     - "langs" array lists programming languages for code samples (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Go).
3. "customPrompts" allows fine-tuning of AI-generated content:
   - "summaryStyle" sets the preferred style for summaries.
   - "descriptionDepth" indicates the level of detail for descriptions.

This configuration enhances the documentation process by customizing AI-generated content and ensuring comprehensive code samples across multiple languages.
