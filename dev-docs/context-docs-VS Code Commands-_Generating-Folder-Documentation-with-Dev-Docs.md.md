# High Level Context
## context
This file provides documentation for the "Generate Documentation for a Folder" command in the Dev-Docs VS Code extension. It explains:

1. What the command does (creates documentation for the current folder in the workspace)
2. Why it's useful (improves project organization, provides context, aids collaboration)
3. Relevant configuration options in dev-docs.json (contextDirs and mappings)
4. Prerequisites for using the command
5. Step-by-step instructions on how to use the command

The document is structured to give users a comprehensive understanding of the feature, its benefits, and how to implement it effectively in their projects. It serves as a guide for developers looking to improve their project documentation using the Dev-Docs extension in Visual Studio Code.

# Example JSON of Relevant `dev-docs.json` Options docs/VS Code Commands/_Generating-Folder-Documentation-with-Dev-Docs.md
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! This JSON snippet represents a configuration for organizing and mapping project directories to cloud storage or documentation structures. Here's a concise explanation:

1. `contextDirs`: An array specifying the directories to be included in the documentation or processing context. In this case, it includes "src/components" and "src/utils".

2. `mappings`: An array of objects that define how local folders should be mapped to cloud or documentation directories:
   - Each object has two properties:
     - `folder`: An array of local directory paths to be mapped.
     - `cloudDir`: The corresponding cloud or documentation directory name.

   In this example:
   - Files from "src/components" will be mapped to "UI Components" in the cloud or documentation structure.
   - Files from "src/utils" will be mapped to "Utility Functions" in the cloud or documentation structure.

This configuration helps in organizing and structuring project files when generating documentation or syncing with cloud storage.
