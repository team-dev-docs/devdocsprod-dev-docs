This Markdown file provides a step-by-step guide on how to generate a llm.txt file using a specific interface or application. The document outlines four main steps:

1. Opening the Create/Update Dialog
2. Locating the File Location Field
3. Entering the File Location
4. Generating the File

Each step is accompanied by a brief description and a corresponding image to illustrate the process visually. The guide is designed to be user-friendly, walking the reader through the process of specifying where they want the llm.txt file to be created or updated, and then generating it.
