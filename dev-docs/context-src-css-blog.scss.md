# ul src/css/blog.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! In this code snippet:

`ul` refers to an unordered list HTML element. The CSS code is using a nested syntax (likely from a CSS preprocessor like Sass or SCSS) to style the `<li>` (list item) elements within the `<ul>`.

The styling does the following:
1. Removes the default bullet points from list items.
2. Adds a dash ("â€”") before each list item.
3. Gives some spacing between the dash and the list item text.

This creates a custom-styled list where each item is preceded by a dash instead of a bullet point.
