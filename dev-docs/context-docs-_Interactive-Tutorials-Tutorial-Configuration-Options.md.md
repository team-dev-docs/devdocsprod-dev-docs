This file provides instructions on how to configure interactive tutorials in the Dev-Docs documentation system. It explains two key configuration options:

1. "tutorial": A boolean flag to indicate that a particular section is a tutorial.

2. "tutorialOrder": An object that defines the structure and sequence of tutorial files. It allows organizing tutorials by language or topic, and specifies the order in which files should be presented within each tutorial.

The file uses a JSON example to illustrate how to set up these options, showing how to structure tutorials for different programming languages (JavaScript and Python in this case) and specify the order of files within each tutorial.

This configuration allows for creating structured, step-by-step tutorials that can guide users through a learning process in a predetermined order.
