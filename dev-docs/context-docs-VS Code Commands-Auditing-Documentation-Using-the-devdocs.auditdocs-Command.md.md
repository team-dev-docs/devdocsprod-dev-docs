This JSON snippet illustrates the configuration for AI-powered document auditing tasks. Here's a breakdown of its structure and purpose:

1. The `ai` object encapsulates settings related to AI functionality within the Dev-Docs extension.

2. The `auditTasks` array within `ai` specifies a list of tasks for the AI to perform during document audits.

3. The tasks include:
   - Checking for potential errors in code blocks
   - Ensuring consistent formatting and styling
   - Verifying the accuracy of technical content
   - Identifying areas where explanations could be improved for clarity

This configuration guides the AI system in conducting thorough, automated quality checks on technical documentation, focusing on code accuracy, document consistency, and overall clarity of explanations.
