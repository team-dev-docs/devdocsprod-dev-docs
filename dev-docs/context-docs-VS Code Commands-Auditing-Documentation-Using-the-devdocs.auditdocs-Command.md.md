This Markdown file provides documentation for the "Audit Docs" command in a VS Code extension called Dev-Docs. The command, `devdocs.auditDocs`, is used to analyze and improve the quality of existing documentation in a project. The file explains:

1. The purpose of the command: to audit Markdown files for issues like grammar, spelling, clarity, and visual appeal.
2. Why it's useful: to maintain high-quality, accurate, and clear documentation.
3. Relevant configuration options in the `dev-docs.json` file, including custom audit tasks.
4. Prerequisites for using the command.
5. Step-by-step instructions on how to use the command within VS Code.
6. The output of the command: a generated `dev-docs_audit.md` file with audit results and potential GitHub issues for identified problems.

The document serves as a guide for developers to understand and effectively use the audit functionality provided by the Dev-Docs extension to improve their project documentation.

## Imported Code Object
This JSON snippet represents a configuration for AI-related tasks, specifically focusing on document auditing. Here's a concise explanation:

1. The `ai` object contains settings related to AI functionality.

2. Within `ai`, there's an `auditTasks` array that lists specific tasks for the AI to perform during a document audit.

3. The two tasks listed are:
   - Checking sections where code blocks might result in errors
   - Ensuring consistent formatting and styling throughout the document

This configuration would likely be used to guide an AI system in performing automated quality checks on technical documentation or code samples.
