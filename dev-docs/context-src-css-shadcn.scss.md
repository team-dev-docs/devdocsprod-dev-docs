# High Level Context
## context
This SCSS file is a configuration for a design system, likely using Tailwind CSS with some custom modifications. It defines:

1. Tailwind CSS directives for including base styles, components, and utilities.

2. A custom color palette and design tokens for both light and dark themes using CSS variables.

3. Base styles for elements like the body and all elements with borders.

4. Custom styles for markdown content, particularly for list items.

5. Specific styling for a documentation page, possibly using Docusaurus as the documentation framework.

6. Overrides for default list styles in the main content area of the documentation.

The file combines Tailwind utility classes with custom SCSS, allowing for a flexible and customizable design system that can be easily applied across a project.

# #__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback src/css/shadcn.scss
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation:

`#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback` is likely a specific ID selector used in the Docusaurus documentation framework. This selector targets a fallback element for the "Skip to Content" feature, which is an accessibility feature that allows users to quickly navigate to the main content of a page.

The CSS rules inside this selector are applying styles to ordered lists (`ol`) and unordered lists (`ul`) within elements with the class `markdown`. These styles set the list-style and left padding for these lists, ensuring consistent formatting in the fallback content area.
