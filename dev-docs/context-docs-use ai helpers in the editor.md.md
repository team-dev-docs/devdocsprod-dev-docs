This Markdown file provides a step-by-step guide on how to use AI helpers within an editor, likely for a documentation or content creation platform. The guide includes seven steps, each accompanied by a screenshot, explaining how to:

1. Open a document in the editor
2. Select text to edit
3. Access AI tools from the toolbar
4. Choose an AI action (e.g., modify length, change tone, fix grammar)
5. Select a specific tone (if applicable)
6. Wait for AI processing
7. Review and adjust AI-generated content

The guide uses a practical example of editing a "Developer Best Practices" document, demonstrating how to transform the content using AI-powered tools. This file serves as a user manual for content creators or editors to leverage AI assistance in their writing and editing process.
