## context
This file appears to be an HTML document for a web application called "devdocs-webapp". It's set up for a dark theme and includes:

1. Basic HTML structure and metadata
2. Links to external resources (favicon, CSS files, and JavaScript files)
3. A script for HTML2Canvas, likely for capturing screenshots or rendering
4. Deferred loading of JavaScript files for performance
5. A noscript message for users with JavaScript disabled
6. An empty div with id "app", which is likely the mounting point for a JavaScript framework (possibly Vue.js)

This structure suggests it's a single-page application (SPA) built with a modern JavaScript framework, designed with a dark theme, and optimized for performance with deferred script loading.
