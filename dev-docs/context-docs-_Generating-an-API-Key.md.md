## Best Practices for API Key Management

When working with API keys, it's important to follow these best practices:

1. Keep your API key secure: Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control systems.
2. Use environment variables: Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your application.
3. Implement key rotation: Regularly rotate your API keys to enhance security.
4. Monitor API key usage: Keep track of how your API key is being used to detect any suspicious activity.
5. Use separate keys for development and production: This helps isolate issues and manage access more effectively.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure the security and proper management of your API keys throughout your development process.
