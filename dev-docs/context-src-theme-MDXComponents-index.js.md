# High Level Context
## context
This file is customizing the MDX components used in a documentation site, likely built with a framework like Docusaurus. It's importing various custom components and UI elements, then exporting them along with the original MDXComponents. This allows the site to use both default and custom components when rendering MDX content.

The custom components being added include:
- CodeSnippets: Likely for displaying code examples
- InfoBox: Possibly for highlighting important information
- DevDocsCard: A card component for the documentation
- DevDocsAccordion: An accordion component for collapsible content
- Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent: Components for creating tabbed interfaces

By extending the original MDXComponents, this file enables the use of these custom components directly in MDX files throughout the documentation site, enhancing the site's functionality and appearance.

# export default src/theme/MDXComponents/index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `export default` in the given code snippet:

`export default` is used to export a single object as the default export from a module. In this case, it's exporting an object that combines multiple components and modules:

1. It spreads all properties from `MDXComponents` using the spread operator (`...`).
2. It includes additional named components like `CodeSnippets`, `InfoBox`, etc.
3. It also includes some renamed components (e.g., `Card: DevDocsCard`).

This default export allows other files to import this entire object of components easily, typically using a syntax like:

```javascript
import Components from './path/to/this/file';
```

The importing file can then use these components as needed, accessing them as properties of the imported object (e.g., `Components.CodeSnippets`, `Components.Card`, etc.).
