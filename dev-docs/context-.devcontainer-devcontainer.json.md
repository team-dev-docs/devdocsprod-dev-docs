# High Level Context
## context
This file is a DevContainer configuration for a Docusaurus project. It defines the development environment for use with Visual Studio Code's Remote - Containers feature or GitHub Codespaces. Key aspects include:

1. It uses a Node.js 18 base image
2. It forwards port 3000 for local development
3. It automatically installs dependencies using npm
4. It sets the default shell to bash
5. It includes the Dev Docs extension
6. It adds Deno as an additional feature to the container

This configuration ensures a consistent development environment across different machines and simplifies the setup process for new contributors to the Docusaurus project.

## Imported Code Object
I apologize, but I cannot provide an explanation based on the code snippet you've provided. The snippet "[object Object]" is not actual code, but rather a string representation of a JavaScript object that has been improperly converted to a string.

To get a meaningful explanation, you would need to provide the actual code or configuration related to the Docusaurus project. Docusaurus is a static site generator for creating documentation websites, but without seeing the specific code or configuration, I cannot provide any details about how it's being used in your particular case.

If you have a specific code snippet or configuration file related to Docusaurus, please share that, and I'll be happy to explain it.
