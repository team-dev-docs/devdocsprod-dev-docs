## context
This file is a DevContainer configuration for a Docusaurus project. It defines the development environment for use with Visual Studio Code's Remote - Containers feature or GitHub Codespaces. Key aspects include:

1. It uses a Node.js 18 base image
2. It forwards port 3000 for local development
3. It automatically installs dependencies using npm
4. It sets the default shell to bash
5. It includes the Dev Docs extension
6. It adds Deno as an additional feature to the container

This configuration ensures a consistent development environment across different machines and simplifies the setup process for new contributors to the Docusaurus project.
