# High Level Context
## context
This JSON file is likely used for documentation or configuration purposes in a project that includes information about a GitHub App. The file defines two properties:

1. "position": 7 - This could indicate the order or priority of the GitHub App section within a larger document structure or navigation menu.

2. "label": "Github App" - This is probably the display name or title for the GitHub App section in the documentation or user interface.

The file is likely part of a larger documentation system or content management setup, where it helps organize and structure information related to the GitHub App feature or integration within the project.

## Imported Code Object
In the given code snippet:

```json
{
    "position": 7,
    "label": "Github App"
}
```

There is no explicit "root" element. This snippet represents a JSON object with two key-value pairs:

1. "position" with a value of 7
2. "label" with a value of "Github App"

The entire object itself could be considered the root of this particular data structure, as it's the top-level element containing all other data within it. However, without more context about how this object fits into a larger data structure or document, it's not possible to definitively state what the "root" might be in a broader sense.
