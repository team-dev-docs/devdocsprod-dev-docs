## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `displayWebviewPanel` in the given code snippet:

`displayWebviewPanel` is an asynchronous function that:

1. Takes a `vscode.ExtensionContext` parameter, which provides access to the extension's resources and utilities.

2. Calls a static method `createOrShow` on a `WebAppPanel` class, passing the extension's URI.

3. This method likely creates a new webview panel or brings an existing one to the foreground.

4. The function then returns the resulting webview object.

In essence, `displayWebviewPanel` is responsible for creating or showing a custom webview panel within the VS Code interface, using the `WebAppPanel` class to handle the details of webview creation and management.
