# High Level Context
## context
This file documents the "Generate Context for Multiple Documents" command in a VS Code extension called DevDocs. The command is used to automatically generate high-level context or summaries for multiple code files or directories within a workspace. Key points include:

1. The command's purpose is to save time and provide quick overviews of project components.
2. It relies on configuration options in a dev-docs.json file, including AI context directories and custom root settings.
3. Prerequisites and usage instructions are provided.
4. The command scans specified directories, generates context summaries, and displays results in the output panel or a new editor tab.
5. It's useful for understanding project structure and individual file purposes, especially in large codebases.
6. The document notes that the quality of generated context may vary based on code complexity and AI model capabilities.
7. The feature supports various programming languages and file types, adapting its analysis accordingly.
8. Users can customize the depth of analysis and output format through additional configuration options.

This documentation serves as a guide for developers using the DevDocs extension, explaining how to leverage the multi-document context generation feature effectively and efficiently. It aims to streamline the process of understanding and navigating complex project structures, particularly beneficial for team collaboration and onboarding new developers.

## Imported Code Object
The `devdocs.generateMultiContext` command generates high-level context for multiple files or directories in the current workspace. It provides brief overviews or summaries for each, which is useful for projects with multiple components.

This command helps developers quickly understand the structure and purpose of different parts of a complex project without having to examine each file in detail. By automating the context generation process, it significantly reduces the time required to grasp the overall architecture and functionality of large codebases.
