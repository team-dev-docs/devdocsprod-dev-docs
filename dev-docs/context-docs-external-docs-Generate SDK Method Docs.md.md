## context
This file provides instructions for generating SDK method documentation using the dev-docs tool in Visual Studio Code. The process involves three main steps:

1. Editing the dev-docs.json file to target specific functions or elements for documentation.
2. Running the "Populate External Docs" command in VS Code.
3. Reviewing and merging the generated documentation in the GitHub repository.

The document guides users through configuring the dev-docs.json file, executing the documentation generation command, and accessing the resulting documentation in a new branch on GitHub. It's aimed at developers who want to automate the process of creating and updating SDK method documentation for their projects.
