# High Level Context
## context
Unfortunately, I cannot provide a high-level context for the code file static/img/install_the_github_app/step_1.png because the file is not accessible. The 404: Not Found error indicates that the file does not exist at the specified location or cannot be retrieved. Without access to the actual file contents, it's not possible to analyze or describe any code it may contain.

The file path suggests it may be an image file (.png) related to instructions for installing a GitHub app, specifically the first step of the process. However, without being able to view the image, I cannot confirm its contents or provide any meaningful context about what it depicts.
