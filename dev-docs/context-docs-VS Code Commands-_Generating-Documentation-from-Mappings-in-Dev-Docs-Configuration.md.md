Key points:
1. The command utilizes mappings to associate files/folders with specific documentation sections.
2. It explains the relevant configuration options in `dev-docs.json`, focusing on the `mappings` property.
3. An example JSON configuration is provided to illustrate how to set up mappings effectively.
4. The file outlines prerequisites for using the command, including having a properly configured `dev-docs.json` file.
5. Step-by-step instructions are given on how to use the VS Code extension command efficiently.
6. The purpose and benefits of using this command for maintaining up-to-date documentation are clearly explained.

# Generate Documentation From Mappings docs/VS Code Commands/_Generating-Documentation-from-Mappings-in-Dev-Docs-Configuration.md
## Imported Code Object
The "Generate Documentation From Mappings" feature is a powerful VS Code extension command that automatically creates and organizes documentation for your codebase based on predefined mappings in a `dev-docs.json` configuration file. These mappings link specific files or folders to corresponding documentation sections or categories, streamlining the documentation process.

Key benefits:
1. Organizes documentation according to project structure, enhancing navigability
2. Ensures documentation stays current with code changes, reducing inconsistencies
3. Streamlines the documentation process, saving time and effort

The command utilizes the `mappings` property in `dev-docs.json`, which specifies:
- `files`: Individual file paths to be documented
- `folder`: Folder paths containing multiple files to document
- `cloudDir`: Target documentation section for the mapped files/folders

To use the command effectively:
1. Set up `dev-docs.json` with desired mappings, carefully considering your project structure
2. Run the "Generate From Mappings" command in VS Code
3. Review the generated documentation to ensure accuracy and completeness

This approach helps maintain accurate, up-to-date documentation that aligns with your project's architecture, facilitating better collaboration and understanding among team members.

New feature: The command now supports custom templates for different file types, allowing for more tailored documentation generation. Specify templates in the `dev-docs.json` file under a new `templates` property to customize the output format for various file extensions.
