# devdocs.generateContext
## Imported Code Object
The `devdocs.generateContext` command is a powerful feature of the VS Code extension that utilizes AI to analyze selected files or documents in your project. It generates a concise, high-level summary that explains:

1. The file's primary purpose
2. How it fits into the overall project structure
3. Key functionalities or components within the file

This tool is invaluable for developers who need to quickly grasp the context of specific project components, especially in large or complex codebases.

# Example JSON of Relevant `dev-docs.json` Options
## Imported Code Object
```json
{
  "contextDirs": ["src", "lib", "components"],
  "internalTypeFilters": ["class", "interface", "function"],
  "codeFilters": ["import", "export", "async"],
  "nameFilters": ["handle", "process", "render"]
}
```

This JSON snippet configures the AI-assisted development tool:

1. "contextDirs": Specifies directories to include for context analysis.
2. "internalTypeFilters": Defines code constructs to consider (e.g., classes, interfaces).
3. "codeFilters": Lists specific code patterns or keywords to focus on.
4. "nameFilters": Specifies function or method names to prioritize during analysis.

These options allow fine-tuning of the AI tool's focus, ensuring it analyzes relevant parts of the codebase and generates appropriate documentation or assistance.
