# High Level Context
## context
This file describes a VS Code extension command called "Outline for Current File" (devdocs.outlineForCurrentFile). The command generates a structured outline of symbols (variables, functions, classes, etc.) in the currently open file, aiding in code navigation and understanding. The document explains the command's purpose, benefits, relevant configuration options in dev-docs.json, prerequisites, and usage instructions. It emphasizes the command's utility in improving code navigation, comprehension, and documentation generation. The file also provides an example of how to configure the command's behavior using JSON options in dev-docs.json, allowing users to filter and customize the outline based on symbol types, code patterns, and symbol names.

## Imported Code Object
This JSON snippet represents configuration options for an AI-related feature, likely used in a development or documentation context. Here's a concise explanation:

1. `ai`: The main object containing AI-related settings.

2. `internalTypeFilters`: An array specifying which types of code elements to include, here focusing on "function" and "variable".

3. `codeFilters`: An array of keywords to filter code by, in this case looking for "export" and "async" in the code.

4. `nameFilters`: An array of specific names to filter by, here targeting "Symbol" and "getSymbol".

These options are likely used to customize how an AI tool processes or analyzes code, focusing on specific types, patterns, and names within the codebase.
