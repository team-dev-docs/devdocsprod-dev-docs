## Imported Code Object
In this context, `<CodeSnippets>` appears to be a custom XML or JSX element used to encapsulate multiple code examples in different programming languages. Inside the `<CodeSnippets>` element, there are two code blocks:

1. A JavaScript code snippet, denoted by the language identifier `javascript` and a file name `example.js`.
2. A Python code snippet, denoted by the language identifier `python` and a file name `example.py`.

Each code block is wrapped in triple backticks (```), which is a common syntax for marking code blocks in Markdown.

This structure allows for organized presentation of code examples in multiple languages, potentially for documentation, tutorials, or comparative purposes. The `<CodeSnippets>` wrapper might be used by a rendering system to apply specific styling or functionality to these code blocks.
