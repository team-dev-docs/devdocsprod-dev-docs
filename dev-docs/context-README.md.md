# High Level Context
## context
This README.md file appears to be for a project called "Dev-Docs Repo". It serves as a basic introduction and starter template for the repository. The file includes:

1. A welcome message
2. Information about the creator (AVB)
3. A code snippet showing a command to run the project using npm

The presence of an npm command suggests this is likely a JavaScript or Node.js based project. The command includes options to run the project and make it accessible on all network interfaces (--host 0.0.0.0), which is often used for development or testing purposes.

This README provides minimal information and is likely intended to be expanded with more details about the project, its purpose, setup instructions, and usage guidelines as the project develops.
