## context
The CNAME file contains a single line with the domain name "ai-generated.docs.dev". This file is typically used in web hosting and DNS configuration, particularly for GitHub Pages or similar static site hosting services. Its purpose is to specify a custom domain for a website, indicating that the site should be accessible via this custom domain rather than the default hosting URL. In this case, it suggests that the associated website or documentation is intended to be accessed through the domain "ai-generated.docs.dev".
