1. Audit docs: AI-powered scanning of existing docs for improvements or changes.
2. Analyze docs: Evaluating the quality of documentation for different user personas.
3. Generate content: Creating new docs based on existing documentation and codebases.
4. Generate docs from code objects: Producing documentation for specific code objects in a codebase or SDK.
5. Generate complete docs: Creating a full set of documentation pages for projects without existing documentation.
