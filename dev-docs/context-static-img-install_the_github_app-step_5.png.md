# High Level Context
## context
I apologize, but I cannot provide a high-level context for the code file because the file is not accessible. The "404: Not Found" error indicates that the image file "step_5.png" in the specified path (static/img/install_the_github_app/) does not exist or cannot be retrieved. Without being able to view the contents of the image, it's not possible to analyze or describe any code that might be contained within it.
