# High Level Context
## context
The file docs/_audit.md appears to be empty or not provided in the context. Without any content to analyze, I cannot provide a high-level context for this file. Typically, a file named _audit.md in a docs folder might contain information related to auditing processes, security checks, or documentation about system audits, but without seeing the actual content, it's impossible to confirm or elaborate on its specific purpose or contents.
