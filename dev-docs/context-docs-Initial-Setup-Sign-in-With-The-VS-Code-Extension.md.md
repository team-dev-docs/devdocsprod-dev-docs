This Markdown file provides instructions for users to sign in to the Dev-Docs extension in Visual Studio Code. It is part of an initial setup guide, specifically focused on authenticating users within the VS Code environment. The document outlines a three-step process:

1. Locate the Dev-Docs login button in VS Code
2. Click the Sign In button to initiate the login process
3. Select the user's organization from a dropdown menu

The file includes images to visually guide users through each step, making the process more accessible. The sidebar_position metadata suggests this is part of a larger documentation structure, likely the third item in a series of setup instructions.
