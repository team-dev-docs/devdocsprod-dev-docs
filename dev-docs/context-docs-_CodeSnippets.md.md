# High Level Context
## context
This file appears to be a Markdown document with YAML frontmatter, likely used in a static site generator or documentation system. The file is named "_CodeSnippets.md" and is located in a "docs" directory, suggesting it's part of a documentation project. The content is minimal, consisting of:

1. YAML frontmatter with a title "My MDX Document"
2. A single line of text: "Hey this is coolooo!!!!"

The ".md" extension and the presence of frontmatter suggest this could be a Markdown or MDX (Markdown with JSX) file. The purpose of this file might be to serve as a placeholder or example for code snippets in the documentation, though it doesn't contain any actual code snippets in the provided content.
