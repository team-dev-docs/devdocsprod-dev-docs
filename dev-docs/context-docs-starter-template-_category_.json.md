## context
This file is a JSON configuration for a documentation category in a documentation system, likely for a website or application. It defines properties for a category named "Starter template":

1. "position": 6 - This sets the order of this category in relation to other categories, placing it sixth in the list.
2. "label": "Starter template" - This is the display name for the category that users will see.

This file is typically used in documentation frameworks (like Docusaurus) to organize and structure content, allowing for easy navigation and categorization of documentation pages.
