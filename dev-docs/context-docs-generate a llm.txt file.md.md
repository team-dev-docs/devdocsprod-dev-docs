This markdown file provides a step-by-step guide on how to generate a llm.txt file using a graphical user interface. The process is broken down into four main steps:

1. Opening the Create/Update Dialog
2. Locating the File Location Field
3. Entering the File Location
4. Generating the File

The guide includes visual aids (images) for each step to help users navigate the process. It appears to be part of a larger documentation set, likely for a software application or system that uses llm.txt files. The guide is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear instructions and visual support for each action required.
