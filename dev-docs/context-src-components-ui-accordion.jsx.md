# High Level Context
## context
This file defines a custom Accordion component using React and Radix UI's Accordion primitive. It includes the following key elements:

1. Imports necessary dependencies, including React, Radix UI Accordion, and markdown processing libraries.

2. Defines a unified processor for converting markdown to React components.

3. Creates custom components: Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, and AccordionContent, which extend the functionality of Radix UI's Accordion primitive.

4. Implements a DevDocsAccordion component, which is a pre-configured version of the Accordion for use in documentation.

5. Handles markdown processing within the AccordionTrigger and AccordionContent components.

6. Uses React's forwardRef to allow ref forwarding for each component.

7. Applies custom styling using the 'cn' utility function for class name merging.

8. Exports the custom Accordion components for use in other parts of the application.

This component is designed to create collapsible content sections, likely for use in a documentation or UI system, with support for markdown content.

# processor src/components/ui/accordion.jsx
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! In this code snippet, the `processor` is a unified processing pipeline created using the `unified()` function. Here's a concise explanation:

The processor is configured to:

1. Parse Markdown content using the `markdown` plugin.
2. Convert the parsed Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to HTML AST using `remark2rehype`.
3. Transform the HTML AST into React components using `rehype2react`.

The `rehype2react` plugin is configured with React-specific options to create elements and fragments, and to use the appropriate JSX runtime functions.

This processor can be used to transform Markdown content into React components, allowing for the seamless integration of Markdown content within a React application.
