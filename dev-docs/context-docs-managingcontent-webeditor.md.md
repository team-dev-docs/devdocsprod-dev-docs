## Imported Code Object
This code snippet explains how GitHub branch logic works within a documentation system, likely a tool called "Docs.dev". Here's a concise explanation:

1. Editing Branch:
   - Users can select which branch they want to edit from the left side of the web editor.
   - They can choose an existing branch or create a new one.
   - All edits and new drafts are synced to the selected branch.

2. Push to GitHub:
   - Edits are automatically synced to the selected editing branch.
   - Users can push their changes to GitHub using the "Push to GitHub" button.
   - When pushing, users can choose which drafts to include and select the target branch.

This system allows users to work on documentation directly in the web editor while maintaining version control through GitHub branches. It provides flexibility in choosing which branch to work on and when to push changes back to the main repository.

# View raw markdown content docs/managingcontent/webeditor.md
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of "View raw markdown content" based on the provided code snippet:

"View raw markdown content" refers to the ability to see the underlying Markdown syntax of a document, rather than its formatted appearance. In this context, users can switch from a rich text editor view to a raw Markdown view by selecting "Raw markdown" from a dropdown menu. This allows users to see how the document is structured in Markdown format, which is the format used when the document is pushed to GitHub. While editing in raw Markdown is not supported in the web editor, users can edit the raw Markdown directly on GitHub or in a local environment.
