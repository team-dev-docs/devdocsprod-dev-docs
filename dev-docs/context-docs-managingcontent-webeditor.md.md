# View raw markdown content docs/managingcontent/webeditor.md
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of "View raw markdown content" based on the provided code snippet:

"View raw markdown content" refers to the ability to see the underlying Markdown syntax of a document instead of its formatted appearance. In this context, users can switch from a rich text editor view to a raw Markdown view by selecting "Raw markdown" from a dropdown menu. This allows users to see how the document is structured in Markdown format, which is the format used when the document is pushed to GitHub. However, editing the raw Markdown directly is not supported in the web editor mentioned; such edits would need to be made elsewhere, such as directly on GitHub or in a local environment.
