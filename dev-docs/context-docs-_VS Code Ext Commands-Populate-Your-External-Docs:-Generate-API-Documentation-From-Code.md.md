## context
This file describes a Visual Studio Code extension command called "Populate Your External Docs" that automates the generation of API documentation from code. The command analyzes the codebase, identifies relevant symbols (methods, classes, functions), and generates detailed documentation pages for each symbol. These pages are then published to an external location.

Key features of this command include:
1. Configurable through a `dev-docs.json` file
2. Filters for symbol types, code snippets, and symbol names
3. Customizable documentation template
4. Ability to specify the output location within a documentation site

The file explains the purpose of the command, its benefits, configuration options, prerequisites, and step-by-step instructions on how to use it. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining up-to-date documentation and how this tool can save time and effort in the process.

## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of "Populate Your External Docs" based on the provided code snippet:

"Populate Your External Docs" is a VS Code extension command that automates the generation of external documentation for a codebase. It analyzes the code, identifies relevant symbols (methods, classes, functions) based on configured filters, and creates detailed documentation pages for each symbol. These pages are then published to an external location, such as a documentation website or cloud storage service.

The command uses settings from the `dev-docs.json` file to determine:
1. Which types of symbols to include (e.g., classes, methods, functions)
2. Specific code patterns or names to look for
3. The template for generating documentation content
4. Where to place the generated documentation within the external site

This tool helps maintain up-to-date documentation that stays in sync with the codebase, saving time and reducing the risk of outdated information. While it provides a solid foundation, human input is still valuable for adding context, examples, and additional explanations to the generated documentation.
