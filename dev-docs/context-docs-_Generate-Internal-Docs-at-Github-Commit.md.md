# High Level Context
## context
This file provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically generate internal documentation when commits are made to the main branch of a repository. The workflow is triggered by pushes to JavaScript files in the root directory.

Key steps include:
1. Creating a new workflow file in the repository
2. Setting up the workflow to run on push events to the main branch
3. Configuring the workflow to checkout the repository and send an update to a DevDocs service
4. Adding necessary secrets to the repository for API keys and authentication
5. Setting up the GENERATE_ENDPOINT_URL for the DevDocs service

The guide includes detailed instructions with accompanying screenshots for each step, making it easy for users to implement this automated documentation generation process in their GitHub repositories.

# Github actions workflow docs/_Generate-Internal-Docs-at-Github-Commit.md
## Imported Code Object
This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Gen Internal Docs" and is designed to automatically generate internal documentation when specific conditions are met. Here's a concise explanation:

1. Trigger: The workflow is triggered on push events to the main branch, but only when changes are made to JavaScript files in the root directory.

2. Job: It defines a single job called "dev-docs-app" that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.

3. Steps:
   a. Checkout the repository using the actions/checkout@v2 action.
   b. Send an update to a DevDocs service by making a POST request to a specified endpoint.

4. The POST request includes:
   - A timestamp
   - An API key (stored as a secret)
   - A GitHub Personal Access Token (stored as a secret)
   - The GitHub repository name
   - The GitHub actor (user who triggered the workflow)

5. The curl command is used to send this information to the specified endpoint, which is likely a service that generates or updates the internal documentation based on the latest changes.

This workflow automates the process of updating internal documentation whenever relevant changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.
