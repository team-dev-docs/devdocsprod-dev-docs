# High Level Context
## context
This JSON file is likely part of a documentation structure for a website or application. It defines metadata for a category of documentation called "Guides" within the "editor" section. The file specifies two properties:

1. "position": 6 - This probably determines the order in which this category appears in a navigation menu or list of categories.
2. "label": "Guides" - This is the display name for the category that users will see.

This file is typically used by documentation generators or content management systems to organize and display documentation in a structured manner. It helps in creating a hierarchy and order for different sections of the documentation.

## Imported Code Object
Certainly! In the context of web development or content management systems, a file named `_category.json` is often used to define metadata for a category or section of content. The JSON snippet you provided appears to be the contents of such a file.

Here's a concise explanation:

`_category.json` is a configuration file that typically:

1. Defines properties for a specific category or section of content.
2. Is used by static site generators, documentation systems, or content management platforms.
3. Contains metadata such as the category's position in a navigation structure and its display label.

In your specific example:
- `"position": 6` indicates the order or priority of this category (likely in a navigation menu or list).
- `"label": "Guides"` specifies the human-readable name for this category, which would be displayed to users.

This file helps in organizing and presenting content in a structured manner, allowing for automated generation of navigation elements and content organization.
