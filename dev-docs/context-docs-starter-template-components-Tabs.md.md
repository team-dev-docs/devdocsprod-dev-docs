## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `Tabs` is likely a custom React component that creates a tabbed interface. It's designed to manage and display multiple sections of content, allowing users to switch between them using tab-like controls. The `Tabs` component typically:

1. Accepts a `defaultValue` prop to set the initially active tab.
2. Contains `TabsList` for the tab buttons/triggers.
3. Uses `TabsTrigger` components for individual tab buttons.
4. Includes `TabsContent` components to hold the content for each tab.

This structure allows for an organized and interactive way to present different pieces of information or functionality within a single container, improving user experience and interface organization.
