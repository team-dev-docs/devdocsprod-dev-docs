This Markdown file provides a step-by-step guide for setting up user-facing documentation using the Dev-Docs interface. It covers the following main steps:

1. Accessing the Dev-Docs interface in the VS Code extension
2. Checking connected documentation
3. Reviewing setup progress
4. Accessing the user-facing documentation site
5. Setting up a GitHub repository for the documentation
6. Accepting a collaboration invitation for the GitHub repository

The guide includes screenshots for each step and explains how to proceed if you don't have an existing documentation repository. It also mentions that once set up, any user-facing documentation generated by the VS Code Extension will be automatically pushed to the connected repository. Additionally, it notes that users can customize their setup or use an existing documentation repository by visiting the Dev-Docs web application.
