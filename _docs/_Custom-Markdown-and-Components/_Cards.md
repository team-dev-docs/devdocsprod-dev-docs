````markdown

Think of Cards as regular html cards or divs.  By default they are already have some css but you can totally customize them as well.  

Here is an example of how to use Cards in custom Dev-Docs Markdown:

```shell
++{card}++

# Hey I am a card

--{card}--
```

++{card}++

# Hey I am a card

--{card}--
