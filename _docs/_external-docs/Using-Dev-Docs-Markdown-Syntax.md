# Using Dev-Docs Markdown Syntax

## Dev-Docs Markdown

If you want to use extra Dev-Docs functionality but write your documentation in a code editor, then this is the right option for you. Dev-Docs' markdown gives you the same familiarity with regular markdown, but with three main benefits:

- Custom Dev-Docs Components
- Custom Styling and Classes
- Don't need to leverage React

Just go to add any MD file to your <code>docs</code> folder and use the VS Code command: <code>Use Dev Docs Syntax</code>. It create the simple shorthand to write your markdown. From there you should be good to go.
