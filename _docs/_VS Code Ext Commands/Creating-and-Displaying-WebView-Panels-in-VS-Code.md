# Displaying a WebView Panel

## What does this code do?
This code creates or shows a WebView panel within Visual Studio Code. It is an asynchronous function that, when executed, performs the following steps:

1. It calls the `WebAppPanel.createOrShow` method, passing in the `context.extensionUri` parameter. This method either creates a new WebView panel or brings an existing one to the foreground.
2. It assigns the current WebView panel instance to the `webview` variable.
3. It returns the `webview` instance, allowing further manipulation or interaction with the WebView panel.

## Why should I use this code?
WebView panels provide a way to embed web content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) within Visual Studio Code. This code facilitates the creation and display of such panels, enabling the extension to present rich user interfaces or custom functionalities within the editor environment. Some potential use cases include:

- Displaying documentation, guides, or tutorials within the editor
- Rendering visualizations or data dashboards
- Creating custom tooling or development environments
- Integrating web-based tools or services

## What Are Relevant Configuration Options in the `dev-docs.json`?
As this code does not directly interact with the `dev-docs.json` configuration file, there are no specific configuration options relevant to its functionality.

## Prerequisites
To use this code, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. A Visual Studio Code extension project set up with the necessary dependencies and configurations.
2. An understanding of how to create and manage WebView panels within Visual Studio Code extensions.
3. Knowledge of the `vscode` API and its capabilities for working with WebView panels.

## How do I use this code?
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Import or include the necessary modules and dependencies required for creating and managing WebView panels.
2. Define the context and extension URI parameters required by the `WebAppPanel.createOrShow` method.
3. Call the asynchronous function provided in the code snippet, passing in the required parameters.
4. Optionally, you can further interact with the returned `webview` instance, such as setting its content, handling message passing, or responding to events.

It's important to note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger extension codebase and may require additional setup or configuration to work as intended. Additionally, you may need to handle edge cases, error scenarios, and ensure proper cleanup or disposal of the WebView panel when necessary.
