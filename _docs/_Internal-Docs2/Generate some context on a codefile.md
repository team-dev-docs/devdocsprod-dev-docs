## Step 1: Open the Code File

Open your code file in your preferred IDE or text editor. In this example, we're using Visual Studio Code with a dark theme. The file open is `index.js`, which contains JavaScript code for image processing.

## Step 2: Access the Context Menu

Right-click anywhere in the code editor to bring up the context menu. In the menu, you'll see various options for working with your code. Look for the "Dev-Docs" option, which is highlighted in the image.

## Step 3: Generate Context

From the "Dev-Docs" submenu, select "Generate Context". This will trigger the process of analyzing your code and generating contextual information about the file and its contents.

By following these steps, you can easily generate context for your code file, which can be helpful for documentation, understanding complex codebases, or sharing information with team members.
