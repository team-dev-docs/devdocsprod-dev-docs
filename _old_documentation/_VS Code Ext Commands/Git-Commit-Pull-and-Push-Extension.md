# Git Commit, Pull and Push Extension

## What Does This VS Code Extension Command Do?

This VS Code extension command automates the process of committing, pulling, and pushing changes to a Git repository. It performs the following steps:

1. Opens a new integrated terminal in VS Code.
2. Constructs a commit message with the current date and time using the format "Updated developer docs: [timestamp]".
3. Executes a series of Git commands in the following order:
   - `git add .`: Stages all changes in the current directory for the next commit.
   - `git commit -m "Updated developer docs: [timestamp]"`: Creates a new commit with the constructed commit message.
   - `git pull origin [current branch]`: Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository's current branch.
   - `git push origin [current branch]`: Pushes the committed changes to the remote repository's current branch.

## Why Should I Use This VS Code Extension Command?

It saves time by automating the repetitive steps involved in the Git workflow, allowing developers to focus on writing code and documenting changes efficiently. Additionally, it ensures consistent commit messages with timestamped information, making it easier to track changes over time.
